I love Starcraft 2 and other Blizzard RTS, and when I saw that this was being made by some of those same folks, I jumped on before anything was complete, before a road map was released.   Honestly?  I really thought they were on to something with the original campaign, before all the reworks.  Sure the graphics were not great but that was part of the coming fixes.

The remakes, the re-graphics, the re-working of the tech tree, but only partially re-working the tech tree?  But not finishing the re-working of the tech tree?  This has just been atrocious, this game is awful now.  AND I dont have access to over half the game anymore??

steam,206684158,"I apologize to my friends whose time I wasted on promoting this undercooked game's diminishing chances of completion: the product (as of October 2025) ended up being 70% hype, 20% Starcraft clone, 10% next-gen RTS. To call the game ambitious implies that the developers had some sort of vision, a better description is the byproduct of an audacious Blizzard cargo cult.

I received the Ultimate Edition from a giveaway during early access. I played during early access and after ""release"". This $65 Ultimate Edition included some skins, campaign missions, and co-op commanders.
The skins were fine, I wouldn't have bought them at the prices in the store and preferred the default skins most of the time.
The campaign was underwhelming. The missions had glaring flaws with pacing, systems, or narrative. If you ignore the boss fights, missions 6 and 7 were ok and there were different victory conditions between missions, but that's as much praise as I can give the campaign. Both of the unlock systems (Suyin and Tara) were unpredictable, poorly paced, and not motivating. The story, dialogue, and voice acting were rough drafts in need of iteration.
The ""released"" game indicates that co-op is unfinished and I had difficulty finding games and when I did, often one of the players would disconnect. I'd be interested to revisit it once they indicate that it is updated beyond 0.4 but that seems unlikely given that...

The game markets itself as a F2P live service game but over 2 months after launch with no announcements or patches, it seems more like an abandonware ""commercial failure"" as not enough players bought undercooked/un-deliverable DLC for a game that was supposedly ""fully funded to release"". 

Pillars:
Campaign: 5/10 (some hope of fixes in the future but reworks are unlikely)
Competitive 1v1: 7/10 (engine is decent, unified command card has potential, but unit diversity/sound design aren't fun to watch)
Competitive 3v3: 0/10 (they playtested 3v3 over a year ago and still have not released anything)
Co-op: 2/10 (not much but it doesn't crash and maybe they will update it)
Custom Maps: 5/10 (community has produced some decent melee maps with terrain editor but trigger editing is limited)

Overall: 4/10
In the 10%ish chance that they release significant updates to co-op, campaign, 1v1, or 3v3, I'll come back and update my review to a 5 or 6 but it's going to take a lot to turn this around given how Tim Morten wants to move on from this project and void his legacy. 

Value:
F2P: 7/10 (first 3 campaign missions and multiplayer are free, nice to try before you buy anything)
$25 campaign: 4/10 (9 missions of unpolished campaign doesn't hold up to other titles of similar prices)
$65 ultimate pack: 0/10 (includes the campaign but the other $40 are wasted on low value content)",1760412029,2025-10-13 23:20:29

I'm a backer, enough so that I received the statue and name in credits.

The game is buggy (forgivable if worked on over time)
`````Unit pathing is hard, labels on abilities are incorrect, i spent a long time confused about build trees because names were changed or updated inconsistently and the changes didn't filter out to all the units/commanders. These things can be fixed over time.

`````backing the game *very* early on and then finding out that every single thing about it becomes a micro-transaction after launch is crazy. I expect games to have these things to a point. Customizable unit skins? sure, commanders past a specific level, sure, try things out, see if you like it, buy it if you do and keep playing. These things make sense for people that might not be RTS fans and are looking to try one out. Pay a small amount to see if you like it and move on if you don't. And if you love the game, you buy things to support it. But the initial backers (or anyone that backed it before full release) trusted not to be taken advantage of and we paid the price. I will not spend another dime or attempt to pull other friends/people into this predatory environment.

The game has a decent framework but that might be owed to UnrealEngine5 and not the devs of this game.

I hadn't ever backed anything on kickstarter or any other pre-launch funding platform, I, absolutely, will never back anything again. 

The practice of shifting the risk from devs/publishers to players/consumers is unacceptable. You want another $64.99 from me after already having gotten $300.

do not buy this game's content, it's aggressively monitized for mediocre at best game play, nothing feels fluid and the game's balance of micro and macro is painfully at odds with itself. this game is dying and the servers will shut down before too long by my estimate. bye bye stormgate, i had high hope, but this game sucks",1759468167,2025-10-03 01:09:27
steam,205728555,"I really wanted to like Stormgate, but it just isn’t there. From the start, the game feels more like an unfinished early access project than a proper release. The unit movement is clunky, animations are awkward, and the campaign is paper-thin. It’s hard to stay immersed when the basics don’t feel right.

The bigger problem for me personally is that the art style and world building never hit the mark. These things are the foundation of any lasting IP — they’re what draw players in and make them fall in love with a universe. Stormgate never had that foundation, so there’s nothing to really latch onto. That could still have been fine if the core RTS gameplay was exceptional, because there’s always an audience that doesn’t care about story or visuals as long as the mechanics shine. But Frost Giant failed to deliver on that too. The multiplayer can have flashes of fun, yet it lacks the polish, depth, and identity to keep you hooked.

On top of this, the monetization feels off. Too much is gated or sold piecemeal when the game already struggles to justify its price with the content that’s here. Instead of feeling like you’re supporting a finished product, it feels like you’re paying for promises.

In the end, Stormgate tries to be both a spiritual successor and something fresh, but it doesn’t succeed at either. Without a compelling world to invest in and without the mechanical excellence to win over RTS diehards, it ends up being a disappointment.

steam,205462368,"Visuals:

 It is okay, could be better.  The line-of-sight is not great, I’ve done a mission where I’m given an objective, but to be able to complete it I need to be able to see where I need to go, and by that I mean in-game, not on the mini-map.

The units all have a very Starcraft feel to them, at least the human ones do, I’d suggest it can be quite hard to separate the visuals of the units, the buildings have a similar problem, there is not enough difference between the buildings.  Having a ‘base’ that is multiples of the same building to churn out enough units in a short space of time is an interesting choice. 

When you are building, the visual overlay saying where you can build is very good, leaving you able to be precise in building placement.  As you can expect, some buildings have different footprints, so maximising your space is crucial.  You will find that it is better to leave a slight gap around your building unless you want to get your ground units stuck between them.

The bits pre-mission in the dropship are ok, it can be difficult to focus the camera as it’s a small space, the camera controls are a bit sensitive.  One room is not as clear as the others due to its location, and the camera sensitivity, it also has objects added to it which can obscure the vision.  Main characters have a visual indicator when they have something to say, a green overhead marker for the main story, amber for additional dialogue lines.

UI:

Like with most RTS games, the camera is above the action, giving you vision over what you see, In my view, the camera doesn’t zoom out enough, which can be frustrating.  The camera controls are okay, but they can get uncomfortable after a while.  I would like to see an option, to switch the camera to a ‘WASD’ scheme.  I have a few reasons for this, the key binds are much nicer to use in this scheme, not reaching across the keyboard to use a key-bind.  The second reason is that most other modern games use it, so you’re not having to change depending on the game.  Third, it reduces the strain on your wrist

The UI as a whole feels cramped, you have the main interface across the bottom portion, which takes up a large amount of real estate.  You have the mini-map bottom right, with the army panel being in the centre.  On some missions, there is a panel across the top of the screen.  This can be either map-wide powers or a big weapons platform; this shrinks the screen area even more.  You can scale the UI, I chose to make it smaller, but your mouse stays the same, so my suggestion if the main UI scale gets changed, the mouse size does too.

The left side of the main interface is the good part, you have buttons which act as tabs letting you build buildings, units, do research and others.  This is a welcome change, the ability to do things remotely instead of having to select the buildings/workforce is great, letting you focus on what your army is doing.  If you have heroes in your army, they will sit at the start of your army list.  Your hero powers can be upgraded, but there is an issue when I'm doing that.  Whenever you upgrade a power, it goes back to the standard layout, this can be fine if you only have one Skill -point, but rather annoying if you have multiple.

I would still have the unit-training buildings in a control group, so you can set the rally point.  Speaking of Control groups, they are listed down the right-hand side of the screen.  The Control groups allow you to group selected units and organise them by numbers.  Some units or buildings do not get automatically selected in the group so you will need to manually select them.

Gameplay:

This aspect seems to swing between good, and dull.  Because it is a strategy game, there is downtime, but it doesn’t feel good or useful downtime, there is not much base management to do.  Build buildings using a drone, repair any buildings using a drone, harvest resources.  Personally, I’d like it so that building upgrades made a difference to how you play, for example have the habitat be able to provide more unit cap.  Have a barracks or air-tower be able to specialise in a unit type.  Having a drone which benefits one resource OR the other.

In terms of Army composition, you don’t need many different units, Having an Army of ‘Exos’ was very good I found, especially when combined with ‘MedTechs’ Say for example, one MedTech for every seven Exos.  With that combination of units, you’ll destroy anything that comes close, with the MedTechs, nothing or very little will die.  I trained up the ‘Hurricane’ at the end of the game, but they aren’t as good as I thought (super slow.)

Your heroes can effectively solo bases, especially at later levels, you might need to micro-manage them.  II would highly recommend getting Amara’s heal drone to aid in that.  The drone has a short cooldown too so it can effectively be used on cooldown.  Getting items for your hero is rather useful.  Each hero in the campaign has 6 slots which you can put items in to equip them.  I had a loose order I tried to stick to med-pack, weapon module, armour module, a building item, this left the other slots spare.

Stormgate does NOT have an in-mission save.  No quick-save, either the most you can do is go back to the auto-save.  This could be way back, and isn’t a case of ‘Save often’, just hope you have one nearby.

Stormgate has a nice premise, but I would struggle to say more positive things about it, as it seems to be missing many Quality-of-Life touches.  Some of the gameplay is ok.  The visuals are mid at best.  My list is:

Make the top banner scalable or move it onto the main HUD in some capacity.

Make ‘WASD’ a useable camera option.  I shouldn’t have to change a load of keybinds.

Be able to save in mission.

Tune the army units (make the Hurricane more durable, faster), tone down the heroes damage, especially at higher ranks.

Make the base-building interesting, defending a base should be more than just units.  Yes, you can build a sentry post, but depending on what purpose you want them, having to garrison units to manipulate what purpose it is doesn't feel good

steam,205422981,"I only played the demo of the game with my best bud. Thats about the only biggest sell point I can retain from playing a few match.

What I disliked:

- Already hit with a cash shop with pets. PETS in a RTS?!
- AI is bugged or a second-hand thought:
 After the initial rush, AI stop doing anything. We can see in the graphs. They hoard ressources but do nothing with it nor expand. And the moment you get to their base to attack them, they give up immediatly. Even its one of the AI, both gives up and dont give you the sastifaction of wrecking their shit.
- Portraits, bad. They all missing meshes or poly-blocky like a roblox in-game mod.
- Clear unbalance with the factions. Early mass rush can win you the game easy if you play infernal and playing celestials becomes hard mode due to their turtle-high cost playstyle being not as rewarding.



What I actually liked and what other RTS devs could also do or build from:

- Its a Starcraft/Warcraft good ol' RTS like. We need more like those.
- While some unit designs were ""questionable"", I did liked the fantasy element mixed with the sci-fi.
- How streamlined the worker production are and nodes gathering. Caps you to make a certain amount of workers and then not to worry until you build a new outpost and repeat the process.
- I always like creeps or neutral mob garding ressources or POIs. they didnt do much here, but still.

steam,205347104,"**Stormgate** by Frost Giant Studios isn’t just another free RTS—it’s redefining what a free-to-play real-time strategy game can be. Here’s why it’s hands down the best RTS on Steam right now.

**Next-Gen RTS Architecture**
Stormgate runs on Unreal Engine 5 for cutting-edge visuals and UI, while its custom SnowPlay engine handles the core simulation. This unique dual-engine setup delivers smooth pathfinding, high unit counts, and lightning-fast responsiveness—something legacy RTS games simply can’t match.

**Rollback Netcode with GearUp Booster**
Stormgate is the first major RTS to implement rollback netcode, dramatically reducing lag by predicting inputs and correcting in real time. Combined with the GearUp booster, which optimizes performance across unstable networks, online matches feel fast and fair—regardless of location.

**The Most Social RTS Ever**
Whether you’re playing 1v1, co-op missions, or three-player PvE, Stormgate is built for community. It includes matchmaking, tournaments, shared map tools, and seamless ways to play with friends. It’s the most accessible and socially connected RTS experience to date.

**Massive Improvements Since Early Access**
Since its early access launch, Stormgate has made huge strides in polish, balance, and content. With version 1.0 introducing the full campaign, refined mechanics, and an overall smoother experience, Game state now has greatly improved since EA release. 1.0 is very promising.

steam,205124553,"I’ve played Stormgate across three different stages of its development: an open beta, early access, and the current ""full release"", waiting for it to improve and be somewhat decent, but I think I won't try again.

[olist]
    [*]Open Beta: here I was forced to play coop with two other players, it was a laggy experience and not enjoyable at all. Unlike other games where you can chill while testing units, checking out buildings and such, like an AoE2 early mission where you just don't build militia and can build whatever you like, but here you didn't get that, just thrown into a 3v1 PvE which always had a more competitive player taking care of everything and then me trying to catch up and get at least some skirmishes, and the other guy who was even more casual who didn't even see any action. Matches were over really quick.
    [*]Early Access: I tried finally playing the campaign, but I was disapointed with the art style again, it was a laggy experience and neither the plot, mission/map design or anything hooked me at all, I don't even think I finished the first mission, it was just so boring and not pretty.
    [*]Full Release: I just finished playing the 3 free missions of the campaign, and while it certainly feels improved, there are still so many things wrong with this game. The starting menu isn't nice (the music is fine), that scenario where you have to walk everywhere to talk to characters or start missions was... a choice. Talking with characters feels annoying, boring and a little buggy with the zoom. Totally disliked the human character design, the full portraits and the AI animated mini-portraits. I didn't like the resource number placement, the fact that before jumping into missions you don't have an interactive map to check stuff up. Do the barracks have a limit to how many units can be queued? idk, but if it does it sucks. Some of the dialogue is beyond unnecessary, like a character telling you some item was ""taken by someone, and to somewhere"", which you already knew by that point... I also had a game crash, and several server connection issues, which made me lose progress when playing a singleplayer campaign, always online for what?
[/olist]

Idk, so many things were wrong with this game, and for comparison, I believe AoE3 has like 8 free missions on its trial version, and this only 3 plus having to pay a lot for only 9 more missions, I just don't see the point to this game.

I honestly did not feel connected to any of the races. I was a Protoss player and Undead player in the previous games because I felt like ""That was my race, that was my play style."" But when I played here I tried all three and was confused by the Celestial race, which should be the ""Protoss"" race and I was concerned. The human race was just a regular Terran race and you really only need to use the marines and the melee units. The Devil guys had this one really tall walking guy that died so fast and did no damage.

steam,204323923,"Stormgate's biggest problem is that it is kinda boring and bland.
None of the units feel exciting to use. There is no power fantasy with awesome top bar abilities in single player or coop.
Feels too much like the game designers were so afraid to make something unbalanced, that nothing cool got implemented.

If it was fun I could excuse some of its other problems, such as the terrible writing, voice acting, and sound design that combine to make all dialogue feel painfully muddy and amateurish in both the campaign and coop.

And the lack of clarity in unit design that makes bigger armies just feel like blobs.

Ironically the game devs could learn a lot from Starcraft 2 (or relearn since they seem to have forgotten much).
After playing Stormgate coop for a few hours I went back to Starcraft 2 coop, and everything felt much better. Better visuals, with more distinctive units you can actually pick out.
Better sound design that makes repetitive voice lines a lot less grating, better underlying map narratives that actually feel interesting.
Much better units and commander powers that are actually fun to use.

After playing the campaign prelude I have no desire to pay for the rest of the campaigns. 


Along with the problems already mentioned, it has an annoying dialogue UI where you click through each line, like some kind of Visual Novel, ruins any chance of immersion the bad writing and sound hadn't already killed. As an aside, here is a well thought out example of how the writing could be improved:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormgate/comments/1l1jkvx/critique_of_the_writing_by_a_writer/

The campaign hub is just as annoying running back and forth like it was a mini-mission, except the only mission seems to be to waste my time. 
Not to mention the zoom-in really highlights the poor graphics.
They would have been much better off just copying the SC2 campaign hub presentation instead of creating something their own that are worse and less engaging in every way.

I could have excused much if either the writing or the gameplay was great, sadly neither was enjoyable.",1757857506,2025-09-14 09:45:06

It's inferior in every aspect sadly.. If I wouldn't have played Starcraft 2, then this would be a ok game.. but I have.
The missions were annoying 80% of the time, cuz most of them were time based... The story was meh as well.. I see they tried Kerrigan 2.0 plot.. THEY DIDN'T EVEN ADD AUTO DIALOG!! I wouldn't mind enjoying the story, but even that I needed to click.. click.. click... if they would do that lil thing, then I would be 20-30% more invested in the story, but after 7 missions of clicking the duo dialog of every character I HAD ENOUGH...

steam,204021661,I'd rate the campaign at 7/10. I think it is good enough for this underserved genre. As of time of writing the other components of the game are in Early Access (i.e. they are worse than 7/10). I would only recommend that you buy if you are OK with the story not being continued,1757517937,2025-09-10 11:25:37
steam,204014740,"After playing all the game has to offer, hereby my final judgment of the current state:

Graphics: 7/10
The atmosphere and terrain look great, building and units are fine but not spectacular. The style is a bit cartoonist, but I don't mind that, it makes it easy to recognize what is what. 
Sadly a lot of models feel a bit unfinished, especially the character models and Ai faces are a bit off-putting, so I take a few points for that. 

Story: 3/10 
For a game that focuses on selling campaign chapters, the story telling and character development is medicocre at best, and horrible at its worst. And although the campaign mission play fine, the storytelling is... a nope for me. 

Gameplay: 6/10
The campaign missions are ""okey"", but the story drags it down into the mud, and it's hard to separate them out. 
I think with some polish the missions themselves could be a ""good"", but not when I played it. 
1v1 felt smooth and has working matchmaking and as it's free to play worth a try if you're into comparative rts games. 
The co-op felt unfinished so I will skip it in my judgement. 
They seem to be working on a map editor as well, what could be great in the long run. 

Unit control: 8/10
For both the campaign and 1v1 it feels great, sometimes the pathfinding is a bit off and there are some minor hiccups, but if the whole game was at this level we would be banging. 

Sound: 4/10 
Sound is all over the place, so I will split it up. 
First I encountered weird bugs during the campaign where sounds overlapped a lot or all of a sudden a voice is way too loud. 
Also, all weapons and effects sound off, they don't have any ""boom"" so to say. 
But then the voice actors are great, they can't help it that the lines they bring don't make a great story. 
The game music is also good, but the lack of enough songs makes that they play the same short song on repeat sometimes, what drives me crazy.
Overall really mixed feelings here, but not positive in the end. 

UI: 5/10
Feels and looks unfinished, but it does the job. I like the hotkey system they came up with though. 

Conclusion: 4/10
Let's quickly talk about... the micro transactions. Sometimes a system like this can work great, but I don't think it works here. 
The game 1v1 mode is free but the main selling point, the campaign, is paid for in chapters. Also there are heroes for co-op and classic cosmetics that don't do anything. 
As for now, that campaign is not worth the asking price and with that the whole idea of splitting it up makes little sense for me. 
The game is simply not finished, and with no clear sign if or when it will, I simply can't recommend picking it up. 
We will see if the develops can fix this ship, but it's going to be a rough journey.",1757511579,2025-09-10 09:39:39
steam,203996589,"I am an older guy 55+ and do not play PvP at all so I cannot speak to that part.  I backed this on KS and played on a off during the EA and BETA.  I am having fun running through the campaign and playing against AI on beginner level.  Am I having fun building, upgrading, and fighting against AI? Yes.  It is a lot like Starcraft but not as deep into the story like SC.  

I do not know what the future holds but as for now I am enjoying the game.",1757486215,2025-09-10 02:36:55

We are now being charged again for the campaigns when we payed for a free-to-play game. This is a great way not just to loose players, but supporters who actually care for either the genre as a whole or the company thats behind the game. 

Now that my personal gripe is over, lets talk gameplay. Its okay, starcraft does the gameplay way better. its more fluid, most units in this game dont really feel useful let alone strong. Things might change in the coming patches, but i wont play anymore of the game, cause the campaign does not come with my purchase of the game.

steam,203894426,"I did not know the game even existed , when I learned about it I wanted to give it a try

I can not recommend this one and the reasons why come down to personal preferences : 

1) I like Diablo , Starcraft and warcraft , mashing them all together though to create a abomination of Paladin Like heroes and melee units from warcraft 3 , that fight angels and demons ... in space however It is just so bad it hurts , nothing really lands , its just a chaotic mess and its plainly obvious to anyone that has played same games that the devs thought that seems people loved those games individually they will like a abomination of them combined as well.

2) It has everything I consider wrong in SC2 : cartoony graphics (way more so than SC2) , you have X time to complete missions (absolutely HATE IT) with building having the sturdiness of paper sheet and every single mission looks like a tutorial for the unit you are given for said mission , just spam that one and win.

3)I do not really know how to describe this but seems there is no ""weight"" in attacks , I am pretty sure that everyone remembers the bullets landing sprites / animation back from SC 1, you remember the siege tanks attacks, you remember dark Templar one shoting most unites, you you almost feel the acidity from the mutalisk attacks... in this game ... if you are not paying close attention you do not really feel / see when attacks land , just numbers going down .

4) The entire game seems Clunky, the combat, the movement , the units , the UI

5) Resource harvesting is not intuitive , you knew what you are supposed to do the moment you played warcraft 2 , sc 1 etc etc, in stormgate it seems I have to pay extra attention to resource gathering as if a mini game within the game.

6) Did I mention the cartoon graphics ? it is not just cartoony but UGLY AF , Everyone looks as if they have dwarfism and hit the gym 16 hours daily to make up for the low self esteem

7) The hero inventory UI is ... well bad not intuitive at all and it looks bad

8) If the game was in alpha it would be ... mediocre , currently I just have to say its bad and I do not think it can be saved , cause the issue is very fundamental  for me : Mashing Diablo , Sc , warcraft just does not work.

 Would not recommend where it is now, CoOp is a lot of fun but it is so expensive to play as each commander costs like $5 minimum. Campaign is alright, amazing writing but just like coop its not worth $30 for about 3 hours of gameplay.

Long Version:

Pros:
 - A lot of differences to other RTS's, does not feel copy-paste
 - Gameplay is smooth and different factions are both diverse but still easy to pick up
 - Factions feel like they specialize in one thing over another, which makes you really think about what to play

Cons:

 - Some factions are too specialized, so they can feel bland and act like one-trick-ponies.
 - The cost, it is ridiculous for a game that is still missing about 60% of the overall game with only 1 campaign and minimal maps.",1757284970,2025-09-07 18:42:50

I've played nothing but co-op and it just doesn't feel good compared to some other RTS games. SC2 in particular. In Stormgate the heroes feel very unique, but their armies and play styles don't. Is Blockade a better defensive hero than others? yes, but every other hero can still play defensive and have it be of similar power level. He doesn't get better siege tanks or hedgehogs which are great defensive units who have a siege mode, but he has better infantry that are harder to kill, but that describes most heroes.

steam,203385271,"A promising RTS missing some polish.
  The game looks good, improving significantly from the start of Early Acces. The graphical stylization is similar to Warcraft or Overwatch and it will age well. There are some fully rendered cutscenes of decent quality. Most other cutscenes and conversations are done in a style of visual novel with static 2D portraits. This is a good compromise, given limited resources of the team and certainly an improvement over plastic looking characters seen in in-engine cutscenes of the first campaing demo. Voice acting is a mixed bag, some lines are good, some not. It seems to improve further along the story. For some reason, there is no volume slider for voices and most unit responses were hard to understand.
  The game is a base building RTS with a modern, streamlined interface and levelling hero units. Desings are readable and unit have distinct roles, staying useful into the late game. Campaing maps (Vanguard) are generally well designed, although I have on occation missed a cliff that made a route impassable. Timed missions were fortunately rare. Mission types and objectives were diverse.
  The story is more complex than in the first demo and completely reworked. It was fairly interesting, although most big surprises were telegraphed well before they happened. There are now more characters, with more interactions. There is a transport ship acting as a hub between missions, with character dialogues and unit upgrades, similar to Starcraft 2. The first campaing (Vanguard) tells a self contained story.
  It is a promising game, but nearly all elements could have used a bit more polish.",1756821264,2025-09-02 09:54:24

Even Tempest Rising managed something like 20 missions on its release (10 for each faction), and these guys are wanting $25 for 12 missions full of AI ""assisted"" slop, poor voice acting, etc? Honestly I expected better out of a company full of former Blizzard employees, but if Stormgate in its current iteration is all they're able to manage, maybe the reason they're no longer employed by Blizzard Entertainment is because they were bad at their jobs-- which is a pretty low bar, considering Blizzard's quality over the years.",1756796519,2025-09-02 03:01:59

steam,203112959,"Wish I could give this game a positive review.
I’ve been following its development since the very beginning. It had a lot of promising ideas, and the team behind it seemed genuinely passionate, constantly keeping the community updated. For RTS fans, this game generated a lot of hype — especially given the current inactive state of StarCraft 2 and Warcraft 3. It truly felt like it could be the next big thing.

Unfortunately, the release was disappointing. The game isn’t very well optimized. Unreal Engine 5 is impressive, but for an RTS, performance is everything. Real-time strategy games need to be fast-paced and responsive, yet networking issues and graphical hiccups break the flow of gameplay. I’d imagine some of this has improved over time, but the core gameplay still feels uncomfortable. There are too many misclicks, unintended commands, and awkward unit movements, which make the overall experience frustrating.

Personally, I’d love to see the developers focus more on campaign content or single-player experiences, because the current PvP feels far from enjoyable.",1756475446,2025-08-29 09:50:46

However the campaign suffers from modern writing and it makes it quite hard to take seriously. The overall story seems great actually but the dialogue is really bad at points. I feel like they definitely hired terminally online writers that need to disconnect from twitter and maybe spend some more time reading. I actually think this game would have done a lot better if their free missions didn't have such cringe dialogue that is so off putting. But with that aside, the missions are fun and the game plays really well and feels polished.

Overall if Frost Giant, can overcome its difficulties with the game and attract more players, I am really optimistic that this could be one of the great Starcraft like RTS games.

steam,203085746,"When Stormgate was announced I was very excited for it. I played the early access and had many complaints but still had hope because it was early access. However, the paid cosmetics and pre-purchasing of unreleased content was pretty scummy for an early access game. 

Then ""full release"" was announced and I was surprised it was so soon, but I was excited to try it out again. I really liked the redesign for the Infernals and saw that they redid the campaign. However, it was not much better with the annoying weather effects (DAMN LIGHTNING), random upgrades in the lab, not enough research points to unlock the majority of the unlocks, not able to pick up resource pick ups with a full inventory, poorly written story with many plot holes, weak character design/building, forgettable enemy types, OP heros, and boring ""boss fights"" are just some of the complaints I had. 

For the multiplayer, it is very snow bally. You either get the first Stormgate and randomly get a good unit and push for the win or a player loses too many units and cannot hold the counter attack and gets stomped. The Stormgates feel like such a lazy way for incentivizing players to not turtle. The rewards being random and being a fighting unit is terrible. Maybe make it a way to get vision on the map or get resources. Also the unit balance/stats are unbelievably poorly tuned, the Fiend for example is so incredibly fast and does so much damage, early on a single pair can out damage a building being built which is an insane amount of pressure for the cost of one Brute. Infernals also lost the shields for standing on shroud so they do not really have a reason to spread it and spreading it is temporary for some reason? I know it gives some health regen but even still it was originally added to give Infernals a sense of ""territory control"" which has been lost. Vanguards have veterancy which seems the most powerful of the faction bonuses of the three. The siege tank equivalent is able to be picked up by the dropship WHILE IT IS SIEGED, which is one of the most busted things I have ever seen, especially when they are able to delete an entire base's worth of workers in one volley. For Celestials, you are able to mass expand and unless the enemy cheeses you then you get away with it. Celestials just seem like an unfinished faction and I know Frost Giant said they are going to overhaul the faction BUT IT IS IN FULL RELEASE SO THAT IS NOT AN EXCUSE ANYMORE.

Finally, the shop is full of overpriced cosmetics, which is fine for a F2P game but $5+ for a companion that just roams your main base is just plain greedy. Also two of the main pillars of the game are not even complete, those being CO-OP, and the Map editor. Not to mention the CO-OP campaign and Team Versus are not out yet which is mind-boggling as those are being advertised as the main pillars of the game yet they are not out for the full release.

Ultimately, I am completely disappointed with how Frost Giant treated Stormgate. They wanted to bring RTS to a new generation of gamers but ended up releasing a rushed, buggy, unfinished game which leaves a sour taste in the mouths of many RTS fans. As the saying goes, ""You can take the devs out of Blizzard but can't take the Blizzard out of the devs.""",1756434511,2025-08-28 22:28:31

Or Legacy of the Void but if the Terran were reclaiming Korhal.


I don't think you have to pay for the multiplayer, maybe I am mistaken, so only considering the campaign in this review: it's ok. The character dialogue is not my favorite, too cartoonish & lovey dovey if you will. The story has many what are supposed to be emotional moments for characters that aren't developed very well so it doesn't hit at all. There isn't any type of interesting twist either, you basically have an emperor Mingsk like character who turns on you and abandons you, which is heavily hinted at before that ever occurs. A good synopsis is that the story is a hybrid mix of StarCraft 1s Terran campaign, and StarCraft 2s Wings of Liberty & Legacy of the Void campaign. The Infernal dialogue is rather flat IMO, it's like ""Hahaha, PATHETIC HUMANS, you all DIE!"". It may have been better to not have them say anything; IIRC in StarCraft 1s Terran campaign the Zerg & Protoss are totally silent, bringing a lot of mystery into their motives & designs. 

But I do think the campaign missions are fun, and help you get you use to the game mechanics. It took me like 6-7 hours on normal difficulty, so it's not very long but that's to be expected for an RTS. Also, I didn't have any bugs I encountered during the campaign, so that's good! I am interested to see how they will take the next campaign, and I am looking forward to the multiplayer to see if that's also fun.",1756043798,2025-08-24 09:56:38

Elephant in the room: why copy a starcraft?! Super-strong feeling the game does not have any personality and uniqueness. Like the game does not even trying to build something new and define it's own RTS rules.

On the other hand, production quality is very high. The game feels solid for the most part. Controls are responsive, all baseline RTS mechanics are in place (like adequate pathfinding, targeting of enemy units, economy is familiar and does not requires much explanation).

The story feels ok-ish. Disliked boring preludes on a mothership with walking and talking before every mission. can't zoom out to see more of battlefield: camera too close to the ground. When the mission is loaded: ""continue"" button is active and plays click animation, but the mission starts only after several angry clicks. Please fix. Button should work ASAP as soon as become visible.

I buy a game and now I have the choice to buy the extra stuff but in this case it is in the form of playable characters. Apex Legends has the same system but at least it seems a bit more fair. You have the chance to still win and unlock the characters. Also, if you buy into the battle pass, if completed you receive the money or battle pass amount back. If money wasn't an issue which it is.

This isn't a patch for a game that has existed for 15 years, this is a brand new attempt to help the RTS genre gain some traction and attract new players, and I gotta say, I'm having a lot of fun.

People too often let the perfect be the enemy of the good, and it really shines in this game's reviews. The game is free without the campaign (which I wouldn't recommend purchasing at $25 without major revisions, maybe $10-15 current state), and balance patches will come with time and feedback, just like every game.

Plenty of these reviewers played the game for 1-4 hours before saying ""wah, this isn't SC2"", and I hate when people do that to games that are obvious attempts to expand on the genre.

I got only some small amount of campaign I was able to finish pretty quick. 

Campaign requires internet connection, and when I was left without Internet, I could not play it. This is not something that is welcoming for Single player. You wanted to take this ""modern gaming"" trend of punishing your customers by making things always online, and you will get appropriate feedback for that. If I paid for something that does not require Internet, I do not want it to be taken away from be because I'm offline.

steam,202553002,"I wanted to like this game. I really wanted to. I admire the heck out of Tim Campbell and all the Blizzard veterans who made such amazing games back in the day. But Stormgate is just awful.

I will say that the devs' hearts were in the right place while designing this to ""bring back"" the RTS genre. The controls, such as being able to click Q and build something by the nearest worker unit or W to train units without clicking on any specific building, are fantastic. I also like how Vanguard units can subtly level up. That makes it fun to see which units have survived the longest. But that's about the only good thing I can think of.

The genre is bad. I get it that the devs worked for Blizzard and wanted some nostalgia connected to their previous games, but they did it so much there's nothing original to be found in Stormgate. The Vanguard are basically Omnica Corporation Terrans, the Infernal Host are Burning Legion Zerg, and the Celestials are Protoss Lightforged Draenei.

The unit and building themes are horribly inaccessible in my opinion—despite the reused genre ""look"" of the game, nothing looks familiar. It's frustrating to try and remember what an ""argent"" is or the difference between an ""exo"" and a ""vulcan."" At least fantasy has tropes that are easy to pick up, but I just can't believe out of all their options they picked another sci-fi one.

The designers are clearly good at making game mechanics based on their veterancy, but the aesthetics, story, and ""soul"" of the game just aren't there. The buildings all look like circular discs with random wires taped to them to make them look vaguely different from one another (not nearly enough differences silhouette-wise), the voice acting is lifeless, the AI-powered animated portraits are uncanny, and the campaign is boring. I just don't care about any of the characters or the world they're trying to take back.

Overall, this whole game just feels like StarCraft II's step-nephew who has a bunch of wide-eyed wonder and ideas that just don't get delivered. I can't believe this is all they could come up with with 35 million dollars. It's really disappointing and probably ruins the possibility of the RTS genre being resurrected.",1755734984,2025-08-20 20:09:44

This game is a failure to achieve anything close to what this genre needs. It feels like a re-skin of Sc2 with some light game play changes instead of a game that stands out. The races feel like they're either heavily inspired by Starcraft at best or just blatant copy cats at the worst. I don't want to play as reskins of Starcraft races I wanted a new experience and they have failed at that. I won't speak on competitive as I havent cared for competitive RTS in a long time, but I do care about what works and what keeps these games alive and that is the custom games community and this game launched with approximately zero premade custom games? What? No DoTA clone? No tower defense? no RPG? These premade custom games are what got me to fall in love with Starcraft and Warcraft.

steam,202421436,"I am so, so, so frustrated with this.
First off, I backed this game. I was so stoked to hear it was previous devs of SC and WC - these are titans in the industry, no?
But...what happened? This....this is insanely unpolished, and more importantly, the entire game is underwater. I read a post where they basically took in a million but they owe investors many multiple millions. 
I don't understand how they could have let this go so off base. The CEO made a LinkedIn post about it.
There are so many would-be fans who are so angry. The game currently has a mixed review - both overall and recent - how did we get here?
This had so much promise. From the little bit I did play, I would have actually said I could recommend it - if there were some small QoL issues fixed, and the camera not being too close to the battlemap - but people are rightfully frustrated.
I backed it, I got the first campaign (?) free because i backed it, and I am enjoying it. But I can't recommend this game to anyone.
Forecasts indicate this game is dead in the water and servers will go offline within a month or two. If that is anywhere remotely accurate, this game is dead on arrival considering it's ONLINE REQUIRED to play.
When I backed it, I did not know it would be ONLINE REQUIRED to play, yes, even the campaign is ONLINE REQUIRED. 
Know what that means when the servers shut down? It means the game becomes a brick.
No refund.
Nothing.
For this reason, I never buy/play ONLINE REQUIRED games (very few exceptions made).
I just....I'm so tired of shitty studios. This had such potential. This is what you get in 2025 when game development is run by CEO's, project managers who don't know anything, and upper management that fails to have any creativity.
What killed this game is a failure of leadership. The crappy thing is, those with golden parachutes are going to land safely at another company - just so they can screw it all up again - while the actual developers who put blood, sweat, and tears into this, whose passion and creativity were stifled, are going to lose their jobs.
SC/WC team, I want you to know I love you all. I hope you all do well no matter what.
Upper management, this failure is on your shoulders.

It would seem like the art, animations, UI, voice lines, story, etc. are still in development, and that the next patch would replace more of the placeholder assets. Except it's supposedly ""done"" and launched into 1.0. What that means is that this game feels and plays like a bad starcraft knock-off. I get that it's ex-blizzard devs and starcraft was the inspiration, but even the characters and story make me think, ""this is the bootleg Jim Raynor on a bootleg Tarsonis."" Perhaps in hindsight, but they should have been a little more daring and not tried to copy paste starcraft because this was the only outcome of it - a cheap knock off.

Aside from the gameplay, the monetization is extremely worrisome. Countless Kickstarter promises have been broken and the game is already stocked with MTX purchases for things like coop commanders that are allegedly still in ""beta."" A third of the game was released under a fake 1.0 launch while the other 2/3 is still in development or ""beta."" Very disingenuous marketing and leaves little faith and hope that Frost Giant Studios will ever truly finish this game. I will be surprised if they even finish the zerg and protoss campaigns before the inevitable black background, white text ""it is with heavy heart that development is ending"" post. They burned through tens of millions of dollars and will most likely move on from this project once they have the bare minimum in the game.

Please mentally add after each con ""... but I understand and appreciate the insane amount of work and passion that went into making this game and there is only so much a small team with limited personnel and resources can do compared to the Blizzard team who released SC2 in 2010. In no way am I questioning the skills and intentions of the dev team.""

PROS:
-Though not a fan of the art style itself, there is no denying that it is coherent and well implemented. The graphics are beautiful, smooth and I think they'll age well. 'Too cartoon-like' was a criticism of SC2's graphic style, and we can all agree that it aged really well.

-The engine feels responsive and polished. Even though I'm still unlearning a lot of my SC2 habits, it should be intuitive for new players. 

-The three factions feel distinct and have a strong visual identity. I'm excited to explore the other two factions.

-I forgot the name of most units, but I really liked:

 The Celestial probe/worker (feels very alien)
 The Celestial scouting cat-looking thing (I like that it perches on trees. I don't remember units interacting with the map in SC2/BW other than for collecting resources and destroying rocks)
 The Atlas (I love its design and that its siege-mode attack can be dodged. Makes you think strategically.)
 The Goliath-like mech unit with a machine gun (I just think it's cool!)
 The Vanguard Capital Ship (It felt amazing to control and loved that it's like a mix between the Terran BC and Protoss Carrier)
 The sword man infantry  and the ranged infantry guy of the Vanguard (I like than both ranged and infantry are available in the early game, and I really like the infantry has a laser gun. Yes, I'm a simple man.)

These are the units that stood out the most to me. I didn't mention anything from the Infernal simply because I did not play them. I did enjoy playing against them a lot though!

-Music is pretty good. The main menu theme does an excellent job of making me wanna jump into a game. The in-game music of the Vanguard and Celestial was good and time will tell where the soundtrack ranks next to SC and SC2.

- A lot of people complained about the SFX and I don't know why! I thought the sound design was pretty good overall.

CONS:
-Some seriously cringe-inducing dialogues which I don't think are necessarily to be blamed on the voice actors. It seems like a lot of important story points had to be condensed and it makes for awkward dialogues and exposition at time. The fact that I played only three campaign missions and cringed multiple times during and between each mission is not good.

-The multiplayer maps feel more like Warcraft maps than Star Craft maps. Of course this game isn't supposed to be Star Craft, but the maps don't feel sci-fi. You know that the setting of SC and SC2 is hard sci-fi just by looking at the maps. I don't really get that here. That being said, I haven't tried every map available so maybe I'll have to edit this point later.

-The art style. As previously mentioned, it's unquestionably well made and implemented,  but I'm just not connecting to it. I prefer my sci-fi gritty and depressing (the original SC totally nailed it!). If they were selling a Doom & Gloom art asset pack, I might consider buying it.",1755476455,2025-08-17 20:20:55

Grew up on SC and Warcraft 2 & 3 and I've played through the SC2 campaigns, as well as a bunch of SC2 co-op online so when I saw this being advertised as the ""SC successor"", I figured I'd give it a try. I played through the first two free campaign levels and I'd can't help but feel like if this had come out when SC2 came out, it would have been fine. Just fine. Unfortunately, it's 2025 and this game really falls flat with unimpressive graphics and very mid gameplay. The UI layout is disappointing, using 'items' (?) is awkward, and the dialogue really falls flat. I'm not at all interested in seeing how the other two factions play.

J’ai toujours joué au RTS de manière assez intensive à un niveau décent puis après une longue pause , j’installe Stormgate et c’est bien simple , je prends un énorme plaisir sur ce jeu. 

Les raisons :

SG est un jeu très simple à prendre en main. Les RTS sont des jeux intimidants en PvP car le côté mécanique du jeu est  difficile mais ici le système de Quick Macro, les groupes de contrôles automatiques , les sorts en auto cast font que le jeu est très agréable à jouer et même sans avoir un Apm de Coréen on arrive à faire de très belle chose. 

Personnellement je n’ai aucun lags ou problème en jeu , c’est fluide et j’apprécie le fait de pouvoir jouer avec le monde entier car il n’y a pas de serveur par région comme SC2. 

L’équilibrage est délicat il y a encore du travail la dessus mais c’est valable pour tout les RTS au départ. 

Bref SG c’est le RTS ou je prend mon pied car j’ai la sensation de faire de belles choses ahaha cela flatte mon ego.

(Not like anyone really plays this game) and you lose your progression in the mission you're doing and this can happen many times over and gets rather annoying. (Save your money)

This game still would have several more years before it's even polished, the maps in the campaign are rushed  and not thought out properly. The overlays of conversations with everyone with a static picture taking up the whole screen with writting is obnoxious. The old style they had was so much better, and why is the character ""Blockade"" look more with realism then anyone else?

steam,202267397,"First, a necessary warning: the entirety of the game is online-only, so any time and money invested could be lost soon!

Also, this is not a review of the Ashes of Earth campaign, which is a separate DLC (with the first 3 missions free). This game has other game modes that are part of the free-to-play content.

The free-to-play game modes available right now are:

[list]
[*]1v1 Ladder
[*]1v1 AI Skirmish
[*]3-player Hero Co-op
[*]Custom games
[/list]

The 1v1 ladder and 1v1 AI Skirmish play basically the same, where you go head-to-head with one of the three distinct factions, Vanguard (humans), Infernals (demons), and Celestials (angels). The 1v1 AI Skirmish also has a couple enemy personalities to play against, which give some gimmicks and buffs to their base faction. I haven't tried the 1v1 AI Skirmish, but the basic RTS gameplay and the faction design of both modes is good. A lot of elements will be familiar to StarCraft players, but there are plenty of small differences and some new ideas that make Stormgate unique.

My personal favorites are:

[list]
[*]Vulcan mechs that can dash through tree lines, opening new paths
[*]Atlas mechs that walk around on four legs and deploy into a siege mode by squatting (I just like the animations)
[*]Sentry posts (bunkers) that can be loaded with a worker to turn them into repair stations
[/list]

There are some significant improvements to the StarCraft 2 formula, such as:

[list]
[*]Quick-macro shortcuts: makes base-building and unit production easier in mid- to late-game.
[*]Automated control groups: units can be added to controls automatically, and you can customise this.
[*]Stormgates: capture points that give you special units.
[/list]

The faction designs are still evolving, and while it would have been better to release the game in a more finished and balanced state, the changes are going in the right direction and what's here today is enough to create some fun games.

[h3]Sigma Labs[/h3]

The other two game modes, Co-op and custom games, are more interesting to me, and sadly those are the least complete game modes (classed under ""Sigma Labs"" in the game). The Co-op is outdated and only gives you a single free hero to play until max level. The other six heroes are free-to-try until level 5/20, then about $10 each. Also, it's almost unplayably laggy on my machine, which to be fair is below the minimum system requirements.

The custom games are created with the editor, which is capable of making regular 1v1/team melee maps only. A few madmen have gone far beyond the limitations in order to create some real custom games, like [i]Stormgate Battle Arena[/i], and [i]Run From Your Doom[/i], which I have enjoyed the last few days. I want to see a thriving custom games scene and that will only possible with the full editor functionality, and a better custom games browser.

There's a notable lack of regular team melee matchmaking, but with the current player counts it probably wouldn't work well anyway. I have played a couple 2v2 custom games and that works fine for me.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]

Overall the game is very rough around the edges (many missing tooltips/explanations, inconsistent framerates/latency, some visual noise / legibility issues, several bugs), and the factions are a bit generic and lacking backstory/campaigns, so I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone in its current state. If the developers can keep the lights on for a few more patches, then this game could really shine. The developers are responsive to feedback, sometimes it just takes a while, as seen during the game's evolution in Early Access.

If you want to try a new Blizzard-style RTS, Stormgate is worth checking out. It's free and getting better with every patch. There is also the Ashes of Earth campaign DLC, which is pretty good, just a bit short.",1755368074,2025-08-16 14:14:34
steam,202267174,"I honestly enjoy this game. It does need some work; the units really need some more character, e.g. in their voice responses. There's actions that seem to be missing audio cues. But I think the game is basically solid. The story may not be amazing, but I'm enjoying it so far. The interface is pretty good. It takes a lot of cues from StarCraft 2 and then adds new improvements such as a special way to handle attack-moving vs. moving with the mouse. I hope that by supporting the devs they'll continue to add and improve. Give this game a try if you like RTS's. It's not perfect, but it really does have certain charms.",1755367844,2025-08-16 14:10:44
steam,202262922,"Yeaaaah, no... This game should still be cooking in the early access. Not be released.

If you wished for some cinematic feeling like in Warcraft or Starcraft, this just has their guts on them, smelling like them but isn't actually them... Its a poor disguise.

I won't mention the ridiculousnes and marketing move to pay for the game and rest of the (only first) campaign seperately.

But i will mention how it requires you to be online in order to play SINGLEPLAYER CAMPAIGN! Also, god forbid if your conection gets interupted cause it will boot you out of whatever mission you were doing and back to the main screen!
It did this to me several times even with my internet being fine.

I do not care about the co-op or multiplayer but i heard that might be the only thing thats actually sort of good and actually thought out.

Im here for the campaign only and let me tell you, the 12 missions are definitely not worth the 24,50€ price tag.

I can see the potential it has, the characters, the spirit... but as of now, it falls flat on its face. If you wished for cinematic cutscenes or animated conversations as you could have seen in Starcraft 2, this won't be it. Stills of the characters in dialogues with like 1 or 2 alts for different mood is a cheap move. The whole thing has a very bland and underwhelming tone to it. Ofcourse it ends with a cliffhanger but im sure as hell not looking forward to more campaigns.

The units are recognizable from each other and look nice but there isn't much strategy to what you produce for an army. You can never go wrong with a muderball of mixed forces. 

I appreciate the command limit of 300 but the static defense could use some work.

In the campaign there is also an upgrade table and overall faction bonus table, think? But don't worry, the 12 missions definitely don't give you enough money to buy every upgrade, why would you want that?

For the sound, well, the soundtrack isn't very memorable. Same goes for the units, cause you will always hear only your hero anyway. The impact of gunshots and fighting is somewhat convincing but it could be better.

As for characters themselves, the design has improved since early access. Main character Amara definitely looks and acts as a protagonist now. The voice acting is very good too but the scenes don't let it show enough, as i mentioned before with the stills of characters.

So, i do not recommend it as of now. Either wait for big sale or wait till all the campaigns are out... Or just stay far from this and hope for something better to come this way.

steam,202247148,"I so desperately wanted to love this game, like I loved Warcraft and Starcraft - and the devs used these as their credentials for buy in. I ignored the initial negatives and bought it anyway, but it really wasn't worth it. It feels like a crappy SC2 mod, and to be honest I bet this campaign will be made by someone in the SC2 editor and it will be better than this.

I wrote some notes as I was playing as I got more and more disappointed:

- Constant crashes (not crashes to desktop, full system locks that needed me to turn the power to my PC off and on)
- No save during the campaign, which I just can't get past. There's even a post by someone from FG responding to a complaint about this and they say that it's only because the game is in early access and will be added in the future :|
- Crashes + No save meant some VERY frustrating missions, kept getting crashes during the same section of a few missions, redoing ~15/20 minutes numerous times. How was it released like this...

- Very distinct unit profiles on the screen. In a blob of units I could only pick out the big stuff like Battleships and Firestarters.
- Very uninspired units for the human faction in the campaign, about 75% have a direct SC2 counterpart, with minor variance.
- Movement is very janky a lot of the time. Units just glide across the ground.
- Why arent unit stats on their card at the bottom? Why the need to hover over the weapon and armour?
- Units creep forwards whilst on defence - this is so frustrating, on heavy defensive missions you have to constantly go back to your defences and move the units back.
- Hero portraits in top right often dont work - heroes dont appear in ""select all combat units"" button , just buggy as hell.

- Saturday cartoon characters - similar to the worst of the new blizzard. The saturday cartoon villains constantly telling us they will crush us and having tantrums over the intercom. Did they not learn that this was terrible from D3?
- Underwhelming, boring story. Basically just burning legion 2.0. The narrative felt all over the place, multiple threads that stopped and started with the ship conversations, very hard to keep track. I still have no idea what the arkulus was, other than a huge deus ex machina at the end. Why didn't she just do that with the arkulus to start with?
- Mostly lacklustre missions which mostly don't showcase the units they are supposed to. 

- Profile missing in end of mission screen, not that I care about storm points or whatever they're called, but they dont work half the time
- AI talking heads, just don't put something like that in, it looks so bad.

- Tedious ship conversations - 2 per char, felt forced, like some corporate mandate
- They were also very janky, another thing that lacked polish and felt unfinished.

As so many others have said, you need a solid campaign for something like this to get a critical mass of people to stay for custom games / multiplayer, but this campaign won't do that.

This review is for the solo players wondering if the campaign is worth their time and money. The short answer, in my opinion, is [b]Yes.[/b]

This is the SC2 DLC campaign we haven't gotten in years since Nova Covert-Ops 9 years ago, just under a new name. The missions are creative, the gameplay is smooth and responsive, and it feels good to play.

[b]The Good:[/b]
[list]
[*]Creative mission design, scratches that Blizzard-style campaign itch.
[*]Super responsive, polished gameplay. It feels good to control the units. Managing the production requires a fraction of the APM that in SC2 (which is very good for the casual campaign enjoyers)
[*]A fair price for a 12-mission campaign of this quality. It is less than 3 eur per mission (2 eur if you include the free missions in the package)
[*]Includes a Steam achievement system. While not as satisfying as SC2's, it's great that it exists and will hopefully be improved and extended to other game modes.
[/list]

[b]The Not-So-Good:[/b]
[list]
[*]The lore is cheesy and half baked. I did enjoy it once I embraced the cringe, though...
[*]The art style has been at the center of the critics. It drastically improved since the early access release but it kept the cartoony vibe that leans on the mobile game aesthetics. Might not appeal to everyone but this was not a deal breaker for me.
[*]Many other modes (Co-op, 3v3 mayhem) are still a work-in-progress or in development. The 1v1 mode is free, so you would be buying this package only for the full campaign access.
[/list]

[b]Verdict:[/b]
If you are an RTS fan starved for a new, blizzard-style campaign, buy it. You're getting exactly what you're looking for. The game has improved immensely since early access and is on the right track... if they manage to keep working at it which I hope.",1755285660,2025-08-15 15:21:00
steam,202200041,"I'm just figuring out this game, but so far a lot to like actually. pvp is fun, and while generally fast paced it seems well balanced. Not overly prone to cheese and frustration. The campaign is a little lame tbh. Each chapter only has 3 missions in it and you only get one for free. Paying 8 buckaroonies seems a little steep for 45 min of game play. Also voice acting and writing is pretty C tier at best imho. No humor, bland lines delivered awkwardly. Sometimes I wonder if the voices are AI generated it's that bad.

This game will receive a lot of criticism for not being up to the SCII standard. And that's not wrong. I think some things are nicer personally. Macro is a little easier, don't need to mess around with making sure all your buildings are hotkeyed etc. Overall game play mechanics are good I think but overall universe is a little sparse.",1755283883,2025-08-15 14:51:23

One problem I have right now is with the perks of the Stormgate. It's hard to see what I am picking in the potential heat of  battle. It would be fun if it was much more easily identifiable and usable in the moment. 

Its getting there. It's got SO much good shit on the horizon, and itll only get more interesting. once they introduce the 'heroes' into gameplay that will be cool, too. If will of course look like the past games, but with this new urgency mechanic - stormgates, it can really make its own unique mark in the genre. The silent hero in the background is the editor which opens the game up to the creativity of people like the early developers of the MOBA genre - essentially defining a large chunk of current gaming meta as we know it.

But on the plus side it lets me play on a widescreen monitor without having to do screen size gymnastics.
Edit : Few modes for multiplayer, no informations of what the strength and weakness of various coop commanders are. 
And if someone told me this was a temu copy of starcraft I'd tell them it's believable.

Tried Coop afterwards, choose difficulty ""Beginner"", got in match with difficulty ""Annihilation(1)""(show at game start) which was trivially easy. And short. Also, only one coop commander is free, every other costs 9(?)€.
No unit is explained or has a tooltip, so I don't know what enemy units/buildings do without playing them myself. And there are multiple armor and weapon types, where some have advantage (i.e. +5 vs Heavy) and others dont, desplite being Type ""Claw"" as well.

1. It suffers from a never-ending identity crises. The devs are clueless and constantly changing mechanics on the whim.
2. The faction balance is atrocious. The fact that they admit this, and tell you not to expect it to be balanced early is a joke. Why even bother playing ranked?
3. The factions are also ""incomplete"" and/or reworks in progress. Yeah. That's just what everyone wants in an RTS.
4. There's no community, or a very small remainder of it that's left.

The playthrough of the ""campaign"" is literally 3 maps before you're forced to purchase it.  They made it seem like ""hey, the campaign is free to play,"" only to find out that it's pretty much just the prologue you can play for free.  Those 3 maps were ""meh"" at best, the script and voices are bleh, the story seems to ripoff elements of a certain Blizzard RTS...

On top of that, the ""on rails"" objectives in the campaign are not even remotely intuitive.  You're on your ship (ship I think?) talking to people to do the next objective, and it says ""talk to {person}"", so you're like ""who's that?""  You walk around every corner of the map looking for them (because it doesn't pop up in your screen because YOUR OWN SHIP IS IN THE FOG OF WAR.)  Eventually you find them and continue the story.

I'm out, never spending a cent on this game again. And that stinks, because this ""1.0"" version has definitely shown improvement.

steam,202127699,"Idk about the modern technology and the engine used to make this game. As a consumer I look at it and I rate it against what i've played before and how it runs. 
This game looks barely better than a mobile game (even after the lighting update), still looks worse than SC2 and barely produces 30fps on any level of graphics set in the options menu, compared to over 150fps in SC2. Even with the decision to approach the ""cartoonish"" style didn't pay off. WC3 almost quarter a century later still looks better stylistically than this, and we all know why the chose that style - lack of proper talent so it's easier to deflect the graphical quality issue as ""artistic"".
But we all know it's just coping, because if it wasn't, then how come a game produced over 20 years ago and stylised the way it was for technical limitations looks better than the game stylised like that today, when there are no technical limitations? Just have a look at your indirect competitor - Tempest Rising. Both made on UE5, only 1 of those games looks like one (still an average game though).

Side note: 
For the next project or future of current one: Mike, please relocate your HQ to Eastern Europe. Not only you will cut down your overall operational costs by a significant amount, but you will also have access to talent that actually has some original ideas and desire to work to show it and then have monetary reward for it rather than the other way around.

Verdict:

Story: 3/10 - we've seen it before, but there's a way to present it - this is not it
Graphics: 4/10 - it's kinda crisp(now), but it's lifeless. Nothing interesting about it
Gameplay: 8/10 - it's a decent attempt at mixing the pace between SC2 and WC3. This has potential.
Optimisation: 4/10 - you either need to optimise the ""computations"" or make the game look like it deserves the FPS you're getting
Overall: 4.5 - i've definitely seen worse and after the EA release, I did not expect much, yet still got disappointed. The gameplay, definitely has potential and is very evidently been the main focus, however it is very evident that esports was always going to be the focus of it and I just find it baffling that nobody stopped and said: ""Shouldn't we make a game for the normies first and then see how we can make an esport out of it?""

This is a [b] ""Yes, but..."" [/b] review.

[h1] Campaign [/h1]
It's fine...  But nothing amazing.  The story is pretty basic.  The characters are pretty shallow.  And the gameplay of the missions is pretty standard with one or two exceptions.  You have some missions where you build up an army and deathball into the enemy base.  And you have some missions where you control a hero and a small group of units and do little skirmishes.  And you get meta upgrades in between mission to improve your favourite units.  It's pretty standard fare these days.  But I think still worth it for the price if you're an RTS fan.

[b] Positives [/b]
Mission 11 was my favourite.  That had some great environmental challenges and was by far the most interesting!

[b] Negatives [/b]
The quality control on the writing and story was very meh.  A twist bad guy appeared halfway into the campaign, and despite him not introducing himself to the characters at all, they all suddenly knew his name and referred to him as such.  While I, the player, had to infer who the hell they were talking about.
There are also 3 side characters that appear late into the campaign that aren't introduced or referred to at all previously, and the main characters are all like ""Heeeeeeyyy!!!  My best friend!!  I've missed you!!""
And two of the main characters suddenly declare ""I want you in my future"" despite having no build up to it at all.
Lastly, there was quite a lot of ""tell, don't show"" in the story.
[spoiler] At the end of the final mission, Amara goes all super sayan and blows everything up with magical space lasers from her hands in a cutscene.  Instead of having that as a cutscene, give me a super powered celestial Amara that single handedly ruins entire armies with powerful abilities, and then let me play out the final fight against Warz, with all these hugely powerful abilities that hurt Warz just a regular amount.  That would show the power imbalance between these two characters and everyone else around them [/spoiler]

[b] Suggestions for the Future [/b]
- More missions like Mission 11.  Having something unique and interesting about the gameplay.  
- Have longer missions (1 hour?) that have mission objectives that change during the mission.
- Show, don't tell [spoiler] Let me play with an overpowered Amara.  Don't just show it in a cutscene [/spoiler]
- Give me side quests that I have to actually devote time and attention to (more than 2 minutes), and give me a tangible reward. [spoiler] The gun platforms on the space mission are a good example.  More of that.  But tell me what the reward is when you offer the side quest so I can make an informed decision if it will help me [/spoiler]",1755136770,2025-08-13 21:59:30

Pushing through Ashes of Earth my overall thoughts are the missions are mostly fine. The last two need to be looked at again towards the end of the missions tho.

But HOLY CRAP... the story sucks, the characters are flat, lines are disconnected and mono-tone. The story doesn't know what it is trying to tell you. Riker is the only real character in this story and thats because matt mercer actually gave him emotions. Me and my friends called the story a B movie plot but on the last two missions.. well it was so horribly terrible i kinda want my money back.

Controls (for items specifically) aren't always responsive. The ""grayness"" of the first 3 missions (which is how far I got) feel like a terrible idea. I would expect better quality from a game running on Unreal Engine. I was okay with things not being finished during Early access since it's expected, but now that it is published, it still isn't. I like the changes however the core of the game feels bad. I am not enjoying it. Considering how much I've played StarCraft II and what expectations I had from the development team (former Blizzard devs) I am very disappointed. I have a feeling like this isn't where the game should have ended up, but here we are. A lot of things make me think that the game is just rushed for release to find more funding, but in the end this is and IMO will create more negative perception of the game. I'm even having issues with login in when I'm not doing something different.
I hope it continues to evolve to something better, but I don't believe this will be possible without serious refactoring.",1755100594,2025-08-13 11:56:34
steam,202048071,"Compared the the EA launch of the game it has made improvements. The vibes of the different factions and tone of the game have been improved upon. The game itself, while better, still has a long way to go and it makes me wonder why they chose to fully release the game with so much of it still unfinished. 

The campaign is so far not good. I've completed about half of it and the story telling is disjointed and uninteresting. I will say its better than what launched at EA but that is setting an extremely low bar. Having the campaign being told in sections of 3 missions at a time with only a total of 12 missions makes for a very short story with shallow characters. They also chose to go with the SC2 model of story telling in between missions and I would recommend they instead follow a SC1 model (Ex. Major characters talk via coms/displays). Instead of having us run around a very uninteresting ship/homebase to have seemingly meaningless dialog with side characters; I'd recommend telling a compelling narrative in a more simplistic way that engages players with the story. I think this would simplify campaign development and allow the voice actors a better chance to shine. 

The true disappointment of this game is the way its being sold as a product. Going the F2P route has clearly angered a majority of the players. IMO, it shows that they intend to milk the player base for future subpar content. I did back this game on Kickstarter and I don't regret my decision as I love the RTS genre. However, I do agree that logging in at EA and not owning everything that was available after spending $60 did sting and left a bad taste in my mouth. 

Overall, I do not recommend this game. The game has clearly improved from its very disappointing EA launch with the factions themselves being more interesting, the look of the game massively improving, and the core gameplay of the 1v1 being better with the addition of Stormgates. However, the campaign lacks a compelling narrative and fails to make the player care about the characters or the setting. The monetization of this game is extremely disappointing and if this is what they consider to be a finished 1.0 released product I do not have faith further content will improve. 

Hope they prove me wrong!

Played through the first campaign on brutal and was an enjoyable experience; although way the missions are structured was a bit awkward.
Random gear drops feels weird when we have a currency shared between unit upgrades; hidden research etc.
Maybe just spending the resource to unlock new abilities on your characters would be a better fit? 
I never played the old warcraft games so maybe this was inherited from those games.

EDIT: also not being able to refund the upgrades you purchase is frustrating when future upgrades are hidden and there is not enough resources to buy everything.
So If I upgrade the units I have unlocked now; I almost certainly wont have enough to purchase the research tier 4 by the end of the campaign and who knows if it'll be worth saving for it.

steam,201986587,"I've played a little bit of Stormgate periodically since its initial release into Early Access, and have played a few 1v1 games since its ""release.""

I'm a firm supporter of the vision of Stormgate -- WC3/SC2-style RTS with a variety of game modes, especially Co-op campaigns or missions.

My buddy and I used to play Starcraft 2 Co-op every single night. The missions, enemy composition/variety and mutations created a lot of variety in how you would work together to complete your objectives, so after support for SC2 ended, we have both been keeping a close eye on Stormgate's progress. 
It has been a little disheartening to see how priorities have shifted from here to there over the course of Early Access, especially away from Co-op modes and features. It is still unclear exactly what the factions look like in Co-op or if there is any parity with the current campaign/1v1 iterations of these races, but either way, Co-op is on the backburner for now which is unfortunate for players like me.

I think the team's work has been good so far -- they are focusing on the right elements to try to get a dedicated playerbase off the ground, and while I find 1v1 a very stressful proposition for myself, I would gander that many people enjoy playing or watching others play 1v1 matches.

[u]Based off of what I've played so far[/u]:
[u]Pros[/u]:
1. I'm enjoying the overall art style of the game. I think the recent changes to the lighting/graphics system makes the game really pop in certain areas, almost reminiscent a Halo game.
2. There are a number of good changes for RTS games in general here - You don't necessarily have to bind your Barracks to a key, and then start building units. You are able to access all units or upgrades from a few menus with one button, cutting down on the amount of procedural ""busy work"" that you must do with your hands to train units or research upgrades.
3. In 1v1 matches, the Stormgates yield interesting rewards and provide a direct reason for you to fight each other periodically to prevent turtling.
4. I think the Vanguard faction's aesthetic is well-realized, if not very covered ground in several other games.
5. I think the Celestials faction's aesthetics are also interesting and they have a number of cool spell effects for their units that seem unique.

[u]Cons[/u]:
1. The Demon race's aesthetics are just boring. They look like any generic demon you'd see in a child's television show. They seem extremely uninspired as a rule. I'd grant some of the redesigns are great, but it isn't enough. 
2. There should be another batch of missions available before they ask you to pay for more missions. The amount of free content for campaign seems a little barebones.
3. There just isn't a lot here that Stormgate does any better than other RTS games on the market. The Stormgate mechanic is interesting, but the rewards for these tend to yield gamebreaking units/buffs, and the aesthetic for ALL units that you are rewarded after completing a Stormgate all have this weird orange/brown glow. They do stick out, but they look terrible.

[u]Final Verdict[/u]:
I'm still interested in playing Stormgate and WANT it to succeed, but I'm just not the demographic for this game until there is some parity for Campaign Co-op and the dedicated Co-op mode.

It's weird that the game ""released"" when there is an acknowledgement of another full revamp of the Celestials faction, but I'm not privvy to finances and deadlines for Frost Giant and can only assume that there is some internal pressure to gain extra funding/time to work on some of these other features and modes.

It's worth checking out, especially if you enjoy Marines blasting enemies with blue lasers. Hopefully it will continue to receive support as it moves along in development.",1755015352,2025-08-12 12:15:52

steam,201972638,"So, I personally enjoyed the campaign, but there are definitely problems they need to fix.

Problems:

The writing needs another coat of paint. Everyone (especially Tara) is way too cheerful. I kind of wish there was either low morale among the crew or heavy propaganda to set the tone (maybe a mission to secure stimulants for the crew to keep up morale would be fun?). I think Amara would be an interesting character IF she wasn't the main character. Her being the mysterious and untrusting character linked to the opening of the gates, who was only friends with Blockaid would give her a lot more room to grow and be interesting. The infernals’ voices and some of their dialogue are underwhelming. Oddly, in the VA interview, they sounded much better — maybe it’s an audio effect they added that I’m just not vibing with. Lore-wise, the number of human remnants should be much higher — at least a few million. It doesn’t make sense for the infernals to bother with mercenaries if they only had to fight a few thousand survivors after defeating a united planet of billions. Finally, the game has way too much strong AOE damage, and the enemy mostly sends units that die to AOE. Reducing AOE damage or adding more bulky enemies would help. 

Positives:

Blockaid’s VA is fantastic. The dialogue is just okay, but the delivery is 10/10. (Not sure if it’s the same actor as the Democracy Officer from HD2, but 10/10). Riker is cool, aside from that bug in Mission 3 where he keeps repeating complaints. Taggart is more interesting than he first appears. If you keep talking to him, you can see how the demons got to him. While it's easy, the gameplay is a lot of fun, and I like the art and look of the game. The robot mission is a ton of fun. Its hard because they attack at 4 angles but I had a blast fighting the BOBs.

Other notes:

I havent played co-op, but it is unclear when and which commanders you have to pay for. I think Blockaid is free? there definitely needs to be a free commander for each faction, and as far as I can tell, only Blockaid is free. Also, for a work-in-progress gamemode, I think more than $5 a commander is crazy. with the pack of commanders ig its cheaper, but if you buy the story mode separately, you miss out on any of those packs, which is really stupid. Finally, idk what social features they've added, but some sort of reward for playing with friends would be smart in the future to grow the game. 

Side note: My bias is that SC2 is my favorite game of all time, and I was NOT a kickstarter of this game. 

Overall:

I think if you are in a place where $25 for about 10 hours of fun and the potential for more if the devs cook is worth it, then get the game. Its free to play and not that large of a download compared to other modern games so I think its worth it to try out for yourself before you commit. RN, Id say gameplay is 8.5/10, story is 6/10, and it has the potential to rise to a 9/10 and an 8.5/10 with the fixes I mentioned.",1755000735,2025-08-12 08:12:15

The maps, the graphics, the mechanics (they added the armory and labs and put two boring female characters in charge, whatever), and the story overall are just pretty dull.

I don't think they ever tested their campaign for once, or they will found out that the unit path finding has very obvious problems. In addition, the rocket unit has no damage against the enemy in some levels of the campaign (such as the first task in Chapter 2).

Also, the devs' attitude is actually quite interesting. Someone asked in the discussion why they couldn't manually save during the campaign (that's right, in a RTS game 2025, you can't save the game during the play).

And here's the response from their community manager:
""It's called an ""achievement"". Food for thought.""
And within a few hours, he banned the person who mocked him back.

The same person kept attacking people who questioned their game in the discussion, the devs just don't give a fxxx about players. Not to mention that they're also banning people and deleting posts related to negative views.

- Nice campaign that sets the scene for this new universe
- In 1v1 every unit feels unique. Also Stormgates feel like a really nice twist on the genre and punishes turtle building in a fare way
- Vanguard has some terran vibes. The main change is that you will now care for each unit. Marines (both ranged an melee) have some hp here, letting you actually save them and units gain veterancy making for a new enjoyable mechanic!
- Infernals are my fav. The poison effect feels sooo nice. Also I feared the lack of zerglins in the early game would be rough, but I ended loving the early game units they have available! Also autocasting abilities are really nice for new players.
- For the celestials, I believe they will be still reworked therefore I did not play much with them. But in 1v1 I did struggle to beat them every single time with those tier 1 units...

steam,201942924,"If you are a fan of RTS, I can recommend Stormgate. 
For those who want to know if it's worth it? After some deliberation I say yes. 

I came in sceptical, but with a desire to like it. Growing up on Warcraft 3 and later Starcraft 2, I knew I'm gonna play this game no matter what. But now that it has officially left Early Access, the game has to be judged by its merits, not by its promises. 
I paid 25 bucks for the campaign, and I enjoyed it. the first 3 missions are free, and they are quite the slow start, which luckily picks up as the missions progress. You get alot of dialogue with the cast between missions, and they are either hit or miss. It really breaks down whether you like their personalities - and they do have some personalities... just not too much of it. 
The missions are fun to play and decently balanced. I've played it through on hard, and some missions did feel to be on the easier side. If you're a skilled RTS veteran, this campaign is not the challenge you've been looking for. But for everyone else, it's pretty good. 

Alot of the missions draw inspiration from Starcraft 2's mission structure, but the variety is quite decent, so I'm taking that as a positive.

The Dialogue and writing ranges from pretty decend  to flat and monotone. I found myself pretty invested at some parts, just to get pulled out by a lame delivery. I was in love with the storytelling in Warcraft 3 through their missions and cinematics, as well as in starcraft 1 and 2. You won't find that quality here. While it pains me to say, the devs certainly had the desire to create an RTS competitor to take on the titans in the field - but the story doesn't possess the care to detail, I was expecting from former blizzard employees and ""Best-selling writer"". 

I played a few Co-op matches, and while the Devs wish to refine those more, it's playable enough to have a good time with your buddies. anyone who played starcraft 2 Co-op will recognize them all, except you get to play them as Vanguard, celestial or Infernals.  No reinventing the wheel, but fun - with some jank here and there. 

I have not tried 1v1, but it's quite competent and for those who enjoy laddering in other RTS should enjoy their time in Stormgate as well. As to the balancing? I heard from RTS Streamers that it has certainly improved, and that the Celestials got quite the overhaul. So feel free and give it a try, and try not to stress yourself out, haha. I know the feeling of ladder-anxiety all too well. but luckily, there's always co-op mode. 

But it's not all positive. There are still afew bugs floating around. 
The game very much feels like a premature delivery out of Early Access to get another cash injection to keep the team employed and working hard on the game. 
The campaign mode is DRM, so always online, which is quite annoying - and no, you don't get brownie-points for saying ""it will be available offline in the future!""- until it's implemented. 
Co-Op mode is not fully polished. Map-Editor is still in its alpha-phase, and some community members have re-created some classic maps already, like a Free-For-All map where you brawl for supremacy with 8 players. 
I can see the ducttape, i can see the seams, but it's holding together. 

Whether you wish to be as lenient as I, is up to you. You can try the game for free, play the first 3 missions, see if you enjoy it enough to buy the campaign, or one of the other options. 
I hope the developers succeed, I myself made several suggestions in their feedback channels, like adding Lore-texts inside the campaign for each unit at the Unit-console. I WANT to be more immersed in the world, and more invested with the characters, but corners have clearly been cut.",1754954425,2025-08-11 19:20:25

Now with the ""stormgates""when one activates, there is a big possibility that the opponents army will be near one , so you can either easily harass the workers/main base or in the late game go into a complete base race. Also a very big MISS on multiplayer - when Main Buildings get destroyed (Command Center, Shrine etc..) and you don't have any more remaining, this doesn't reveal you to the opponent - that means as long as there is a building somewhere on the map.... it can get pretty annoying. Multiplayer would have been fun, if there were more people playing.

**Edited Gripe: The crew is just warming up to you in the prologue. I liked the progression, and them being cold in the first few missions resolves, and dialogue is friendlier and more story relevant past chapter 1.
Almost to the end of the campaign, and I've tried some online multiplayer. The Co-op is awesome!! Gonna have to get my brothers in on it :D

**Mostly came here for a gripe:

One thing I've noticed so far that bothers me, just as a nit pick (and update request, Devs), is that the on ship dialogue with the other crew members seems to punish you for being overly chatty before starting a mission, in the sarcastic way they dismiss you on their last dialogue cue. The biggest reason I find it offputting, at least through mission 3, so far, is that there are chat indicators on the crew that indicate more dialogue. Sometimes there's several cues of story enriching dialogue per crew member, all voice acted very well, but there's no telling when one of them is about to get a little curt with you, like ""why are you still here..."" vibes.

Recommendation: Remove the indicator for the last cue, but still make the crew member chatable.

steam,201936992,"As someone who has played an ungodly amount of RTS hours in AoE2, SC, WC3 (my favourite), and SC2, and who has been depressed about the current state of RTS gaming, this game is a breath of fresh air and has the potential to be a light at the end of the tunnel. 

I know that there's a lot of baggage from the botched early release and kickstarter stuff, but I really hope that people can move past that and focus on what's here now. Also, take off the rose-tinted glasses as well and think about the state of WC3, SC, and SC2 when they first released. Good RTS' take a lot of fine tuning and develop over time. They need a good foundation, but they don't emerge as fully-fleshed products. At this stage, what should be the focus is a solid foundation, good principles from the developers, and a fun game loop. Stormgate has those things. It is fun to play and is one of our best shots of having a game follow in the footsteps of WC3 and SC.

High points include: fantastic netcode, good pathing system, races with fun and unique identities to continue developing (definite inspiration from WC3 and SC here), a novel RTS mechanic (stormgates) that rewards activity on the map and reduces macro downtime and turtling, solid unit design that is a fun blend of SC and WC3 principles, intuitive game play, balanced time to kill for units (longer than SC, shorter than WC3), helpful features for RTS newbies (including novel ones like the autobot), mixture of competitive (1v1) and more casual modes (3v3 with HEROES, co-op challenges, custom games map builder).

Low points: campaign isn't going to have the breadth or polish of major WC3 and SC campaigns, 3v3 and co-op modes unfinished at this time, limited map pool in 1v1, custom game maker needs further development and player uptake to take off. 

I recommend that every RTS player try some free games in 1v1 and the free chapters of the campaign at this point.",1754946757,2025-08-11 17:12:37

It seems odd to me that you'd then charge $25 to people who didn't support your KS and also lock out your KS fanbase unless they add an additional 60% on their investment.

TBH the people who funded the KS are going to be your core community, while I know I wasn't technically promised the full game by any means it seems a bit odd to not even deliver the first campaign to backers.

At this point I don't see this company surviving, the game doesn't have a very unique draw and I'd rather play SC2 coop again with friends or replay those campaigns. I'll go back to waiting for RTS to have a comeback but sadly this game isn't it.",1754937074,2025-08-11 14:31:14

steam,201912829,"Let's just get to the point here. If you are looking for a new RTS in the vein of Starcraft 2, you will be disappointed. Every aspect of this game feels like it wants to be like Starcraft, but it just doesn't have the polish or the basic elements nailed down. The unit controls just aren't snappy and lacks control feedback, everything just feels very floaty. Units would wander off in the middle of battle for no reason. Chaining subsequent actions and path finding are all over the place and inconsistent. Environmental design and visual cues aren't clear or distinct, making things disorienting and everything just looks smudged together. These are things that were solved 15-20 years ago in older RTS games, but it's reappearing here. How can this be a ""new and modern"" RTS when it stumbles over issues that old RTS games had solved. 

The Campaign is very disappointing. The voice acting are not up to par and the cut scenes were not interesting. Starcraft 1's cutscenes and briefings had less production value but is far more engaging and built a much more interesting world than this game could. For level design and unit introduction, it basically tries to copy Wings of Liberty 1 to 1 but fails to interweave the units into the each mission and story. You can basically complete each mission with just the basic units without much issue. Bugs appear frequently in the campaign, events not happening, missing texts and prompts. They try to add some easter eggs like you can pick up a ball and play fetch with a dog, but the execution is just clunky which just sums up this game perfectly. 

All in all, this game is just not fun. It's not something that I'd want to explore more in-depth and I don't care about the second campaign if it ever comes out. Out of all the kickstarter games this is probably the one I had the highest hope on and the most disappointed with.",1754921895,2025-08-11 10:18:15

im really missing the crunch, why are the immortals and celestial speaking english?(the units not the commanders), atleast make them talk weirder. 

overrall i think the game is good, the story is nice so are the characters, co op is fun and the polish is good. but there is much more room to grow here into greater things. the first thing they should do is not try to cepture everything all at once. dont add commander, dont add anything. finish the story, polish the factions and the characters. than branch out everything else.",1754918783,2025-08-11 09:26:23

steam,201906155,"I recommend you give this game a shot! 

especially if you enjoy single player RTS games with diverse asymmetrical factions with solid multiplayer options (albeit still a work in progress state). Although far from perfect, this game have come along way from its initial very rough initial early access (EA) state, and in its current state, it,s SO much better, but still far from a finished product.

Aside from FrostGiant needing a new PR/marketing lead (as whoever was or is still in charge, made a huge mess of both EA & current launch) but aside from this this team are nearly passionate about the RTS genre, and genuinely listen and act on fan's feedback. 

there is a very solid foundation in place, and with ongoing support, and investment this franchise has the potential to be the next big and dominant RTS game, 'IF' it get's ongoing fan support! 

as much as I love Starcraft 2, let's face the harsh reality. Blizzard-Activision couldn't care less about Starcraft 2 as it's pretty much left to die (aside from hardcore fans keeping it alive), and I highly doubt we'll ever see a fully fledged AAA Starcraft 3 sequel).

As of right now Stormgate has 3 playable factions. Vandguards, Infernals, and Celestials. Upon testing out the factions I found out some interesting details.

Vanguards: Can build without losing a worker, Has training time on soldiers, Has to build structures increase unit cap.

Infernals: Building consumers the worker, No training time on soldiers, Has to build structures to increase unit cap.

Celestials: Can build without workers, Training time on soldiers, Immediate army cap set to 300.

Based on just that I discovered that celestials are clearly overpowered for a 1v1 setting. They can increase income quickly and expand quickly. Then build a large force and wipe out the fool who decided not to take celestials.

Ultimately I find myself underwhelmed with the strategy aspect of the game. Please let me know if y'all who have played it longer disagree.",1754885131,2025-08-11 00:05:31

steam,201887302,"I'm pretty disappointed and after a year of closely following updates and a little over $100 in support, I think I'm ready to ignore Stormgate until it proves itself.

They repeatedly pitched this as the finalized version of their campaign, and while part of that is their communications team being bad, the other part of that is them telling you to manage your expectations.

To start with the good: the overall RTS gamefeel here is good, everything feels pretty smooth on that front, and the campaign's missions are interesting, varied, and pretty unique. I can see the impact these old SC2 co-op developers have because those also had some more unique mission types and they're swinging for the fences here.

It doesn't always land though. I feel like the game is bad at notifying you of what's going on. One mission to save some people I only ever lost people because I had no idea where to look for them until after they'd already been hit the first time.  In general I wouldn't realize my base was being attacked if I was in battles because the notifications are so quiet and demure that my base would be halfway busted by the time I got back. Sudden enemy waves and reinforcements on top of some poor in-game communication are not helped by the lack of in-game saves, if something gets the jump on you, you better hope you have a decent auto-save. To be fair, that never impacted me, the one time it might have I DID have a salvageable auto-save. But saying your campaign is feature complete and not having a manual save feature is simply wild. And once I beat the campaign? After it unceremoniously booted me out, no credits roll, the game menu said I hadn't beaten the last 3. You're telling me I didn't finish your campaign? Buddy, YOU haven't finished your campaign. It feels like it lacks artistic direction, as the story progresses with very little compelling stuff going on, bouncing from place to place on your space ship around the Earth, making you barely latch onto any stakes and every mission feel anticlimactic as it just cuts to the oddly olive-colored background victory screen and then Amara waking up on her bunk bed.

But all that would be forgiveable, it's an indie studio. I don't envy their task of having to monetize a niche genre with a player base that doesn't want to move on from their classics, so pitching their $25 campaign as complete because they really need a cash infusion is something that could be fixed down the line. 

But it's seeing where the money is going or rather, where the money SEEMS to be going, that is spitting in my soup (This is where transparency from their communication team would be important). 

I hate to continue giving money to a team that seems to be spending it on celebrity voice cast that doesn't deliver. Mercer is phoning in a character seemingly written to be a token Matt Mercer character, Amara is lifeless for the emotional core of the story, Simu Liu and Metzen's characters are barely developed and tbh Simu's raspy villain voice just doesn't land, Tara I think is some Instagram influencer? I'm not sure but she shouldn't quit her day job that probably earns her more than better voice actors get paid for voice acting. 

I hate to continue giving money to a team that saw those AI generated animated portraits and said ""Looks like $25 to me, ship it"". Amara looks like a supermodel when the AI takes over constantly giving a grinning expression as she screams into the communicator and tells her forces to fall back, Ryker looks like a smarmy a**hole both when he's trying to be and when he's not trying to be, it's incredibly uncanny when people yell their mouths open wide enough for the dentist to give them a full exam, and the shoe really drops in the last mission when a heretofore unseen character shows up with AI animated concept art that reminds me of the early days of deepfaking when people made like presidential portraits sing pop songs. 

This was mostly venting about campaign decisions and places it comes short. I played a bit of the multiplayer at launch but never wanted to invest in a constantly evolving meta with updates, as I'm sure a lot of people can relate. I ran through all the co-op missions at least once too. I was excited to mess around in Sigma Male labs as I did a lot of map editing for fun learning basic triggers and how games like this tick when I was in middle school. But the meta isn't done, so it's still not time to care about 1v1. The campaign is kinda bad, so I feel no reason to continue getting invested in this universe, and honestly whenever I check custom games while I'm on I don't see any games listed. And co-op is just, thrown in the freezer for the forseeable future.

Right now, I have no reason to pay attention to Stormgate. I hope that changes down the line, I'm gonna unfollow a lot of the socials and forget about it, maybe come back when the Infernal campaign launches and all my RTS content creators cover it. I'd love to come back and delete this review if they somehow manage it. According to Steam Charts this game has gone from ~100 daily players to ~800 so hopefully an 8x increase in the playerbase gives them the gas they need to continue making improvements. But to me the problem is what I mentioned earlier, the launch of Ashes of Earth feels like a plea to manage our expectations. In some ways that's fair, in other ways I can't help but have expected better.",1754883528,2025-08-10 23:38:48

steam,201880496,"Giving a negative as there is no meh option. Note I am only reviewing the campaign as I do not play multiplayer and all other modes are not released as of yet. 

Campaign: balance feels all over the place on missions. First few are very easy. I am sure to get into the swing of the faction and units. Mission five has a major flaw which they have not fixed in the past year it has been out. You can build up a full base, max out your army, and research all upgrades before beginning the defense part of the mission. This of course makes it extra trivial. Episode six is still not extremely difficult and has a ""boss battle"", but even on brutal is laughably easy, though at least the team had enough common sense to only take your heroes into the zone. Chapters 2 and 3 have some pretty challenging missions which actually feel brutal defending waves from all sides and then laughably easy and frankly boring missions where you roll around the map with an HQ doing basically nothing until the very end of the mission where you have to hold a point at the end. 

Heroes are a good idea, but make some of the content trivial such as spheres of doom that get two shot by the sniper character. 

Now the hub... in concept I like the drop ship between missions you can get extra lore, and switch out your hero's load outs. HOWEVER, I quickly found myself skipping through even the required conversations as they were one note and boring. Even a ""final stand"" speech at the end of the game which is supposed to be the big ONE LAST CHANCE moment was let down by stale dialogue and (what is beyond me) no music. The equipment system is completed through lockers where you can assign equipment to characters you bring on missions. This is a good idea. However, it becomes very tedious as you have to put the item into the main character's inventory from the stach and put it in the other character's locker. Made even more tedious because she only has 6 item slots which you want to use for her own items. 

Another system is the research and faction upgrades. This system is pretty solid. You have to choose between using resources you get by completing missions to upgrade individual units or upgrade your faction as a whole making heroes and/or units stronger. The issue is that they give you way too few resources. By the end of the campaign you can upgrade one unit out of twelve in your roster (each unit has 3 upgrades) and get the research upgrades. There is just not enough of the resource, perhaps you should get some amount from completing secondary objectives. 

Plot is pretty cookie cutter. First two cinematics hit pretty hard and are decent. Unfortunately there are more than one cutscene. By the end of the game the story is all over the place. Characters are introduced in a mission and then never heard from again. There is a betrayal that has no build up or weight. The third faction is mentioned and you occasionally see units/ghost versions of their units. They are mentioned a few times but no depth to who or what they are. You are just expected to know OH YEAH the celestials. The final cut scene in the game is supposed to be a dragonball z/ harry potter and voldemort duel (you know the one) but is done in a very poor rushed way. 
 
Over all a less than average experience let down by a very obviously unfinished experience. At the $20 price tag, I would say its ok if you have the expendable income. A few missions were enjoyable and brought back the original Starcraft 2 vibes. But over all I felt disappointed at what could have been. 

But at least you can pet the dog on the ship.",1754873171,2025-08-10 20:46:11

steam,201869116,"I mean, there's the free-to-play, and on top of that this is a really fast-paced game so you can form your own opinion quite quickly, probably faster than reading any review.

Probably try co-op. This is supposed to be the ""campaign release"", but I think the co-op mode is the main appeal of this game, also where I have the most games. Also where it has been easiest for me to find games, even while there were not many players online.

If you must play only a single-player campaign, and you must spend money on it, I thought this one was too short (maybe 7 hours). There are lots of single-player campaigns out there to choose from: Tempest Rising, Aliens: Dark Descent, Age of Mythology, Terminator Defiance (with 2 DLCs now), and so on... personally, I've had my fill of RTS campaigns.

I'll admit I had fun, the performance of the engine in big battles is incredible, the effects and arcade-y feeling was really satisfying. It's just if you need your hours-of-play per-dollar metric, you won't get them with this campaign.

However. To enjoy the full game experience, you would need to spend the original $25 for the base game. Fine. 
-----Then you would also need to spend an additional $9 for each commander beyond the first. Which so far is 5, so ANOTHER $45 IN GAMEPLAY-RELEVANT PURCHASES.
-----The reason for this extra cost is because the devs decided to go with a 'gear' system instead of SC2 coop's prestige system. Each coop hero is playable until level 5. Conveniently, each coop hero unlocks generic gears for use in all your missions, at levels 6 and 7. 
-----None of this covers that their $25 game is a whole like 9 missions or something. Very transparent model for tricking people into supporting them, rather than just making their cosmetics the focus for that crap.

1. The top-left corner of the screen says ""N.106307.Shipping-PTR"", which is fine for early access, but wtf is this doing in a full release? Also, doesn't ""PTR"" means ""Public Test Release""? Why am I part of a public test???
2. Graphical glitch in the first in-game cutscene, where the character sitting on the bed was actually sitting too low, so her waist is clipping into the mattress. First in-game cutscene.
3. When finishing the first mission, in chapter 0, the in-game cutscene shows a Big Bad Demon walking toward your group, making big stomping noises. Well, those stomping noises are repeated on a loop in the post-game summary, very annoying.

Otherwise, gameplay was fine. Story is about retaking the Earth from a demon invasion. Fuck yeah.
Bonus points for main character being a woman, who was a child when the demon invasion happened, and her dad died at that time. Well, her dad was never seen again, so maybe it's going to be a plot twist later?

On monetization, they have in-game transactions. There is an innocent-looking chest icon in the main menu, when I clicked it, it showed me various heros with a price tag. Booooo! Also, I couldn't figure how to exit that menu. Double booooo!
On the other hand, the free version was a good demo to show me that this game needs to cook for longer. So maybe their free-to-play model isn't that bad.
However, after the first mission, I got some bonus ""Storm points"", for ""first mission of the day"", which makes me worried that they're going for mobile-style microtransactions? But so far, all I saw that was for sale was the campaign, and individual... heroes? They looked like heroes. I also saw some premium version on steam, but I didn't look into those.
The prices in the in-game shop were all in real money, so maybe they're not going to be predatory.

steam,201847942,"Campaign:
* Missions are different from first early access version
* I found the campaign fun to play (played on first on hard difficulty)
* Caution: Saves only at checkpoints, no free saving! (so you need to have time for a gaming session)
* Atmosphere especially between missions not as great as in Starcraft 2 but still quite good for game without a big publisher.
Coop-Mode:
* Is a mode where 3 players try some special missions together vs AI. You have in that mode a hero you level up unlocking more units/abilities for the next game.
* I liked it more than the Coop in Starcraft 2 as it had more action and cool customization on high levels
* Game mode is marked as unfinished and it shows on some of the maps which feel more like a tech demo.
* Compared to Starcraft 2 very expensive for what is offered
1vs1:
* Much better and faster paced than in earlier versions
* New stormgate mechanic makes it interesting to try different approaches and timings
Editor:
* only terrain editor part is released but data and trigger editor is planned to be released soon
* so there are no fun custom games yet
* also editor license is a bit strange about requiring only to share the maps via game

Some cautions when buying: 
* First be aware that you can tryout some content without buying anything (e.g. if coop mode is finished enough for you to buy coop heroes)
* Also check what the different bundles contain. I bought the ultimate edition indirectly by supporting them on kick starter and got some further advances from that like being able to play the beta. However if you want to just play the campaign there is now a much cheaper bundle with just the campaign. There were (are?) also some other bundles that they probably just created due to kick starter rewards that contained just some missions of the campaign but not all. They had/have very miss leading names like ""Deluxe Edition"". So I recommend double checking what you get before buying any bundle for this game.

The game has not yet as much content or polishing as Starcraft 2. However unlike Starcraft 2 new content is still being developed for it. If it turns out doing well we might get further content in the years to come.

Summary: I think it is fun to play and am looking forward for future versions of that game.

Whole UI is clunked, nonintuitive. Game is talking that I don't have power. WTF is power? Took me 15 minutes to notice a power bar. GUI needs a serious rewamp.
Upgrades are not interesting/nonexistent. Where do you upgrade attack/defense of units?
Units themselves are not interesting.
Attack animations are very poor. It's either pew pew or hng hng. Compared to SC2 for example where you have Immortal or Siege tank that just blasts things, or a Battlecruiser or marine that just goes brrr, these units are basically all the same with slight differences.
Building placement is somehow strange. Maybe it's the scale or what, but idk what's what. Is this a defense building, production, upgrades? Everything looks the same.
As a veteran RTS player this is the first game I lost to an Easy AI. Trying to learn mechanics and what's what and AI attacks me with a whole blown army.
Idk how ppl that made W3 and SC2 can produce this abomination.
In both games you have beautiful units that each have a purpose, have unique attacks, have strengths and weaknesses. Here you build a random assortment of units and fight in a scrimmage and one side wins cause it's probably bigger or sth.

steam,201832525,"I think the current reviews are, maybe not unfair, but at least based on a past that is no longer relevant. The game, albeit not completely finished, is a very decent modern SC2. The issues player have with it seems to be the very tortured development cycle due to mismanagement and the very confusing monetization. (Although some people are really not trying very hard.)

But, for anyone like me, starting the game now, the game is in a very good state and the business model is very fair. You have access for completely free to the skirmish and 1v1 mode as well as the introduction of the campaign, which is more than enough to get a feel of the game and whether it works for you. Then, you basically pay to unlock content brick by brick ""à la carte"". So if you find the campaign good enough, you can buy the chapters 1 by 1 or as a whole. If you want to play the hero mode, you can buy a hero to try it, then buy more heroes if you like it. And if you just want to play 1v1s and skirmish, then you are in luck, you can do that for completely free.

Regarding the game itself, the gameplay is really good and the modernization features work well and are really welcomed. The models and animations are... not to my taste and clearly inconsistent, but serviceable. The visuals overall are in a sort of uncanny valley where your brain keeps switching between ""oh, that's not good..."" and ""oh ! it's kind of good looking"".
The voice acting is terrible and probably the worst part of the campaign.
I am not able to talk about balance or how well designed the faction are, I barely started playing and I only played RTS very casually before.

The game is free to try, it can hardly get more approachable than that. People should take advantage of it and just try it, there are so few action RTS and no real successor to SC yet, give this game a chance.",1754821175,2025-08-10 06:19:35
steam,201827420,"It's a thumbs up from me, despite all the shortcomings. Yes the team over promised / hyped and prematurely released it in Early Access driving a lot of folks away, but at the end of the day what we got is a great looking Starcraft-style RTS with a few notable genuine innovations.

The Grid system for the shortcuts are allows players to macro up without looking away from battles and is very well thought out. It takes a bit of getting used to, but it's worth putting the time into understading it. Right click drag to align units to a path is also very cool.

1v1 and AI Skirmish are fun and probably the most polished area of the game.

The campaign is fun enough, going back for a second play-through on a higher difficulty with a better understanding of the game is a great experience. It does have a lot of negatives however, like the writing being very sub par, with unnatural dialogue and odd line deliveries from the voice actors, particularly the Tara character. The rest of the cast does the best they can with the script their given, but that script is really not compelling. Very cliche story structure, one dimensional villians and there's a lot of ""show don't tell"" rule breaking. That said, the missions mechanics themselves are quite fun and well made.

There's also the occasional bug here and there, and the lack of a Save feature (though the checkpoints are presented often enough), but if you skip the inter-mission hub areas and just enjoy the gameplay of the missions it's a fairly fun experience.

Music is nice, though some tracks feel a bit too repetitive. Sound mixing is currently an issue, with some sounds like when the Stormgates trigger increasing in volume a lot, units not triggering audio feedback on consecutive commands (same with buildings after a few clicks), things like that.

It's a shame we couldn't reach a proper 1.0 release with all factions polished up in terms of mechanics , graphics and complete unit roster, but those that are present are for the most part well done. Unit pathing is generally ok, though not at the level of Starcraft (they have trouble with tight spaces and sometimes get stuck on corners). It doesn't happen often enough to be a real issue, especially in 1v1 and Skirmish.

The game comes with an alpha version of a game editor, which while limited in scope (for now) and a bit buggy it's still impressive what the community was able to create with it so soon.

Co-Op is currently in progress, still using old unit models and abilities but there is a lot of potential here. The game mode itself is quite fun.

To sum it all up, this is great game covered in layers upon layers of issues. If the dev scan some how muster up some additional funding to keep a core team working on it for an year or so, the game can absolutely shape up into a top-tier RTS. Worst case scenario, they close up shop and hopefully grant the community the tools to continue polishing up teh game. It wouldn't result in additional campaign, but it could turn into a fun e-sport.",1754814138,2025-08-10 04:22:18
steam,201825756,"This is a hard review to give a positive to, but I will mostly because the game has VASTLY improved to what it once was.

Pros:
-the unit and build grid system macro/micro is very intuitive and when you get going it feels fantastic what you can do with lower amounts of non pro apm. Seriously felt awesome on the later missions with all you can do
- The campaign actually was a little fun (not a lotta) but it kept me interested and honestly it kept me hooked and wanting to finish it 
-The co-op has potential (3 players) I personally value 3 player multiplayer a lot. So this gets bonus points even if not done super well a the moment
- Battles feel really good in terms of speed. Like honestly a fight happens and your units dont get obliterated in 3 seconds (even though I like that sometimes) 
-Missions felt unique just enough.
-Tim C. has nice eyes

Cons-
-My biggest gripe about the dialogue is the fact there is no voice filters, other than like once. Give them a radio/comms sound effect and it'd improve like half the lines of dialogue. 
-The pricing is wack, 9 dollars after tax for a co-op hero is trash. I'm not going to buy that
-bugs, lots of just minor bugs
-I was not an Kickstarter backer, some people got kinda jipped, I didn't though and felt the campaign was a ""little"" overpriced so thats saying something
-the ship segments besides Tara make me want to stop playing
-No mid game saving (wtf)

TLDR: Slash price on everything 20%, Campaign is good, add filters and polish to dialogue. 

If the devs do see this don't get discouraged by SC2 elitists and just keep working. You're doing great

steam,201815685,"I liked this game. While the campaign is a little on the expensive side for how long it is, I personally found it worth the price. Even if you aren't sure about getting the campaign the first three missions are free. I do, however, have the following criticisms for each of the missions but overall despite the following I really did enjoy it and am really excited for what the future campaigns hold. Don't read if you don't want spoilers, or skip to the very end since I give some more thoughts.

Mission 1 - While it's a pretty good introductory mission, it's on the shorter end of what I would want and the very beginning of it is a bit too difficult since it can decide how the rest of the mission can go.

Mission 2 - This mission introduces one of the problems with items: full inventories. I think it would be best if the storage bin on the ship was available during the missions since it would make it easier to use items effectively. For instance, I didn't use the healing packs or the spare parts for healing, or the insta-posts you get from mission four. I loved how many secrets there are and wish there were even more in the rest of the campaign. The mission is also pretty short and also too easy. (I played on brutal for the campaign)

Mission 3 - Three is the best of chapter 0 (the free chapter). I think making it more obvious that you get Ryker's command post and making the skies even more crowded would make it better and another side objective, like destroying some of the infernal bases since throughout the campaign all the side objectives are too easy.

Mission 4 - Making it more obvious where the infernal weapon is firing, upping the difficulty, and make the unit you get more important for the mission. In general, throughout the campaign the missions where you get specific units should have you utilize those units more. This particular mission could also gain a lot from a bigger map. And the troops that are remaining near the enemy bases should be larger in force but face larger waves of enemies.

Mission 5 - The beginning of the mission should not give you control of the servos. It makes the mission too easy and a bit boring. You should be resource starved, just scrapping by, and really utilizing the terrain, have us knock down more mountains, have us shoot a rope around Malocs horns that holds him back, and have the hero units have more to do, make it so that if you do choose to micro them you can get way more out of them.

Mission 6 - I think if this mission unlocked a better unit, like you're breaking in to get their resources and tech and not just get them off the war. They're with the infernals, imagine we get infernal tech during this mission. Otherwise I like this mission, though I had serious difficulty the first two times I played it since I thought I had to break through the defenses, not go around them at the beginning of the mission.

Mission 7 - Making all of the beginning of the mission a dungeon crawler-like mission would make it better, also the heros aren't microable enough, making Amara's blink cheaper and switching it to healing, making Ryker have a snipe ability sooner and making it more usable would, in my opinion make them better. In addition, the minimap icon of where the Echelon AI is should appear sooner. And the use of infiltrators just to bring up a bridge is not a good feature, and it should be on the side you're on so you don't have to ferry them across with a transport. And there could be more of a variety of music during the mission. I also don't remember what unit I even got access to during this mission.

Mission 8 - Great mission, would make the bonus objectives a bit easier to access and make the places where the enemy commanders are a death trap, like if you go there you just get absolutely wrecked. Also maybe add a few more places you can be attacked, make it feel more like you're completely surrounded and you have to hold out and then get away as fast as possible. At some point maybe Maloc destroys the celestial defenses and you have to hold out against just him with more tanky enemies, like the occasional miniboss and whatnot.

Mission 9 - Having the mission start a bit later, like you get 6 minutes instead of 2 to prepare, a much larger map and more fighting in the streets between your allies and enemies would make this mission really great. The unit you get just isn't useful, it isn't worth making in almost any circumstance. Also having the commander tell you little hints for the strategy you should use, like ""Hey, you should kill the flying explode-y things and then use a flying transport, or having another mission like 3 would be nice here but you control the land carrier instead of the mission. Also the side objective should be more like help the people in the human's prison or something like that where it's kind of your choice, maybe it gives you a buff but also a debuff for the rest of the campaign since you got more people but they're human criminals, like thieves. 

Mission 10 - Have more people defending the arkulus so that when it's taken from you it really looks like it was taken, ripped from your grip, also I'd like to see the fight for it in a cutscene since that would be pretty cool and there aren't enough cutscenes/cinematics. Make the enemies after you defeat all the stormgates waaaay easier since they are waaay stronger then the balls and make the balls waaaay stronger, like you have to use a strategy like knocking down cliffs, or a special missile, since the ball will just destroy your units, or idk, maybe a special arkulus ability.

Misison 11 - Good mission, also make the little anti-radiation drone more obvious

Mission 12 - Make the mission longer and more difficult, we're breaking into a stronghold, and that raptor team with Slogo is so small.

The ship interlude - Walking around on the ship took too long and the characters' dialog should all be more flowing. Each character should have something that sets them apart, for instance, Suyin could be some insane engineer due to the cryosleep, maybe she does crazy things on the ship like starting fires or doing other dangerous things like taking fuel out of the engine so she can make the engine better despite you being in the air. There is also no super cool bada-- character, there are robots and Ai that exist in this universe, give tripp a cool robot friend. Also I read the books and at one point Blockade says that Amara knows earth better than he does even though he lived on earth for longer and he was part of the security with Julian at the sigma sites with Cullin, that being changed would be nice.


Final Thoughts: Despite what I just wrote I really did like the campaign. The story and plot are great, though the characters are ok. I am really excited for the infernal campaign. I get that the campaign isn't likely to have any extreme changes but I hope that this is read by the devs and that they implement some of the less radical ideas in future updates and consider what I said for any future campaigns.",1754796386,2025-08-09 23:26:26

steam,201814223,"I am somewhat worried about the priorities of the devs.

While the cutscenes are nice, if you gave me the option of replacing a cutscene with a mission, I'd replace about half of them.

While having animated portraits when someone is talking is nice, most of blockades' lines are not lipsynced properly, and I would've preferred a static portrait.

I think side content would've been a great inclusion, but I don't think it's possible with how the campaign is structured.

Although I understand that the story can't change on whether you run around talking to people, A CERTAIN EVENT with A CERTAIN CHARACTER is very fucking obvious, to the point that Amara looks like a dumbass for not noticing A CERTAIN DIFFERENCE IN APPEARENCE spilling out from under A CERTAIN PIECE OF CLOTHING, all while they are doing everything short of explaining to Amara's face what they are doing.

I will say that that T.R.I.P.P. steadily going AWOL is very funny, and even if ignoring it is just as unreasonable as it is with THE CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL, it's very funny, and therefor acceptable.

About half of the missions can be relentlessly abused by just spamming hordes of EXOs, as long as you pay enough attention to avoid AOE and dig in on and off for the bonus range. If a dev is reading this, just make dig in take a bit longer, please do not over-nerf the fun out of the game. Oh and please make the third EXO upgrade into something actually good. 25% movespeed slow doesn't really do much when things move as fast as they do anyways. It at most gets the exo one extra shot before engaging or a marginally easier time kiting. Perhaps bonus range on their first attack to give them an alpha strike when entering combat?",1754794262,2025-08-09 22:51:02
steam,201813302,"The game itself as a competitive new RTS is great, it players faster and is more friendly to new players. When I play it in this fashion it is quite enjoyable. Outside of that it needs lots of work. Co-op and campaign are not ready yet.

They made a co-op mode which I like the idea of...but its heavily based around heroes. I dont really enjoy heroes and would hope they focus on that less in the future.

The campaign is still working though bugs, but also made to feel way too dependent on heroes. Unless the mission is meant to be hero only then my belief is there should be no heroes. The use of heroes in every mission doesn't feel like an RTS and leaves me wanting to go back and play the starcraft campaigns. In most missions I don't feel well taught in what I need to do. I end up just running around killing things until I start making progress. Maybe I am better than I when I first played other rts campaigns but I breeze through the hard missions without even knowing what my main objective is. 

Some other complaints - I don't care to click and walk around the ship between missions. I preferred how SC2 went about the in between mission interaction. Just feels like a waste of time telling Amara to walk around the ship. I think the story needs some work as well. I have not been drawn in to the story and am not feeling for or connected to any of the characters. The way Tara talks and sounds leaves me really not liking her character.

I have hopes that this game can make further improvements, rely less on the use of heroes and improve the story and how the story is presented. As of right now the game does not feel ready to be released to me.",1754792957,2025-08-09 22:29:17

The initial campaign rework during early access was a great change and the extra missions released recently have followed the same trend. Each campaign mission has it's own organic twist to gameplay to work around your macro which is fun and engaging, I think the campaign experience is very reminiscent of starcraft 2 and I'm looking forward to the next few campaigns that are being released. The ladder experience in 1v1 is a lot of fun and brings me back constantly to try and improve my build order and army comp, I am hoping for more tier 3 units though as currently there's only 1 tier 3 choice for each faction. The sigma labs modes are all good starts to fun game modes but obviously still need work for replay ability and usage, but the system for coop heroes is very nice and it'll be interesting to see how the devs integrate heroes into 3v3. Overall I'd definitely recommend the game for anyone interested in rts but I'd advise to not expect a perfect game straight away as the game still has a lot more development to come. I'm super excited to see where things go and there's definitely some really great potential here. Almost forgot: The devs should definitely look into a ""tutorial"" people new to rts and stormgate, as it's very difficult to introduce new players to the mechanics for each faction, especially as there are no campaigns for infernals or celestials.",1754759743,2025-08-09 13:15:43
steam,201783446,"Edit: SPOILERS: finally finished the campaign and just can no longer recommend it after how the ending is done.

This is basically a review for the campaign. 

It picks up after the first couple of missions with a notable increase in quality and design at mission 7. The plot overall is interesting though nothing really new. The dialogue writing is... lord have mercy. Best way I can explain it is this writing is textbook ""tell, don't show"". It's all fairly spelled out and stilted. Voice actors themselves did great.

As for RTS game play, it's great. Great responsiveness, speed, pathing. It's missing some key hotkeys like select idle military, select military on screen, etc. I do really wish tabbing through unit types in a group allowed you to individually control that group like in AoE IV. Auto control group is fantastic and the advent of automatically assigning workers to build buildings within needing to go find them is a fantastic skill floor-raising feature without hurting the skill ceiling. Mostly just played Vangaurd because of the campaign and their unit roster is good.

I dunno, $25USD for 12 missions in 2025 is okay value. The production quality has glimmers of greatness with the lingering lack of quality from early access. I'd recommend it if you like RTS.",1754756899,2025-08-09 12:28:19
steam,201782990,What an astonishing disappointment.,1754756441,2025-08-09 12:20:41
steam,201780400,"First things first: this game is obviously not in a state that most developers would even remotely start to consider a ""full release"" and it is not obvious (beyond what seems a fairly desperate attempt to secure more income) why the early game access tag was removed. Higher tier units for all factions are missing, one out of three factions is (apparently) going to be totally reworked at some point in the future, several promised game modes are still not there (and won't be there for a long time) and a lot of stuff in general, regardless of mode, feels very unpolished and unfinished. The game runs very sluggishly and somehow does not have the ""smoothness of a sc2"" while not having the fun ""jank"" of Wc3, AoE2 etc. The sound design has been bad from the get go and seems not to have been updated much since the first days of alpha. 

That being said, even if one were only to judge the game on what is already included while trying to be lenient and ignore how much is still missing, I still would not recommend this game to anyone in its current state. 

It is kind of hard to review this game on much other than the campaign, given the fact that 1v1 competitive while change dramatically with future reworks and balance patches. 

So the review will focus on the campaign. While there are a lot of issues with the campaign overall: subpar voice acting not helped by a lackluster script, a lot of unecessary and badly delivered exposition between missions, lack of ""life"" in the main hub between missions the overarching and main issue is that the game really struggles to deliver a story and characters one feel any reason to care about while at the same time having missions that are so straightforward/unoriginal and not engaging enough to make the fun enough to ignore the lackluster story/characters that are presented. New players will be presented with a main character who barely seems to care about anything with supporting characters whose only character traits seems to be to deliver exposition. The missions are all standard fare and beyond the very first prologue mission very easy to brease through even on brutal difficulty. If you struggle the lack of an actual save function can be extremely punishing for longer missions where a significant time spent can't be recovered because of the fairly randomly placement of autosave/checkpoints. I won't say it is not decently fun if you really like standard RTS campaigns, but I also struggle to recommend this to anyone given how many better campaigns and stories you can out there, most often for a better price. 

Overall, the main question the developers and this game has failed to answer is ""why Stormgate?"" and I fear that this question will never be answered.",1754753955,2025-08-09 11:39:15

Stormgate bills itself as the next evolution of RTS, but what it actually delivers is a bland, uninspired slog that somehow manages to feel both unfinished and outdated at the same time. This game isn’t just “less than basic” it’s practically a masterclass in how not to design a modern RTS.

Let’s start with the gameplay, or rather, the absence of it. The core mechanics are mindless, with almost no depth or meaningful decisions. The lack of a proper tutorial is baffling, unless the devs only intended this game for people who already know how to play Starcraft. Anyone new to the genre is left to flounder in a sea of half-explained mechanics and UI clutter. It’s less a learning curve and more a brick wall.

The writing? Imagine a high school creative writing assignment that was turned in five minutes before the deadline. The dialogue is cringeworthy, the world-building is paper-thin, and worst of all, it takes itself seriously. It wants to be epic but ends up sounding like bad fan fiction.

Voice acting is a mixed bag, with some performances standing out only because of how painfully bad others are. “Tripp” the robot character, is particularly grating, an ear sore that somehow made it through multiple development stages without anyone saying, “Hey, this is awful.”

Visually, Stormgate goes for a stylized art direction but lands squarely in the realm of generic and forgettable. It lacks the crisp, iconic look of Starcraft II and instead feels like an asset store demo. There’s no visual flair, no wow factor, just more muddy designs and uninspired animations.

And here’s the kicker, Starcraft II, a decade-old game, is not only free but still miles ahead in every single category, gameplay, story, visuals, voice acting, and polish. Why anyone would play Stormgate over a proven classic is beyond me.

In a market with RTS giants still standing tall, Stormgate doesn’t just fall short, it never even showed up to compete. Do yourself a favor. Skip this empty husk of a game and go play something that respects your time.

1/5  A relic of what could’ve been, buried under layers of mediocrity.",1754719764,2025-08-09 02:09:24

steam,201750114,"the game definitely has potential and has shown improvement but it is still very rough around the edges rn, I would recommend it just to try the pvp but campaign and co-op are a scam
I spent 25$ for the early access campaign (3 missions) and now I have to spend another 25$ for the rest? and 10 whole dollars for each co-op commander, and only 1 free one?
I understand needing to make money off a f2p game but this is just a complete rip off, especially for a game with such slow and honestly lackluster development",1754715032,2025-08-09 00:50:32

Unfortunately, whatever it was going on behind the scenes, they didn't build a solid foundation to bring players in. Now, this is very likely going to be a slow death of a game that had great potential.

Paying more money for a full campaign is unreasonable. 

The storytelling and voice acting is mediocre.

There isn't any challenge to the game.

steam,201738567,"As a Warcraft III and Starcraft II mapmaker who has tens of thousands of hours in RTS games, I can say that after playing this, I have abandoned all hope in the future of RTS,
With so many devs from War3 and SC2 working Stormgate, I thought it would be the next big RTS game, but I couldnt be more wrong. The Devs continue saying ""We have left early access now"", I dont know what they are thinking. Nothing in this game is complete.
Their main focus and the only well developed part of this game seems to be the 1v1, which I couldnt care less about.
The editor after 2 years of early access can only make melee maps. Maybe if they released it with the editor there would be hundreds of custom games and a real player base but they still refuse to just complete the editor instead of giving attention to literally every other game mode.
The co-op mode has only like 3 maps and the commanders are so uninteresting, especially with the 9 dollar price which is even more expensive than the high quality SC2 commanders.
The 3v3 game mode is still not even out so everyone is stuck with the same repetitive 1v1.
And worst of all, the campaign is so underwhelming and absolutely not worth the price. Its barely higher quality than most player made SC2 custom campaigns, and I somehow prefer the beta version from months ago. they recycled half the missions from that version but got rid of the best ones (Like why ditch the cool micro mission?). And the story is so dry and uninteresting.
If youre a fan of competitive 1v1, trying to make custom games, hoping to enjoying a co-op mission with your friends, or just playing the story mode campaign, this game has a way disappoint you!",1754698103,2025-08-08 20:08:23

To be clear, I am not a PVP player. I like the campaign and co-op aspects of RTS. 
And I was not a kick starter backer. 

In a vaccum, I think the reception for this game would be much much better. The big issue is that they promised a bit more than they could deliver at this speed. They promised to be the next big RTS, a spiritual successor to Blizzard RTS's. People complain it is not as fleshed out as either SCII or WC3. But I still think it is really fun and fresh, even if it isn't quite Triple AAA quality. And I am having a great time playing it. Considering a relatively small studio's first big title, it makes me really excited to see what future stuff they work on!

 This scratches that same itch as that I have been craving for a while in a video game. Each Co-Op hero feels unique and has a different type of gameplay. Also, the ability to use items to further customize each faction was a really nice touch.  And I have gotten over halfway through the campaign and each mission has a nice blend of new units, side quests, exploration,  interesting objectives, and good ol' RTS battles. Its a good time. 

Maybe in time it will be everything the studio hopes for. I for one am optimistic. With some polish and updates, I think it could be one of the greats.",1754691266,2025-08-08 18:14:26

The game has seen major improvements compared to the initial Early Access release on all fronts, but it’s still far from perfect. It probably needs another two years to become a worthy successor to SC2. And I want them to succeed — I really do. The potential is there, and it's immediately clear that the devs know how to make an RTS. The gameplay mechanics already feel great, with interesting and distinct playstyles for each faction.

When it comes to the creative side — the universe, story, dialogues… meh. Not as horrendous as the initial EA campaign missions, but still mediocre at best. I want an immersive, rich sci-fi world to explore — not cheesy one-liners from some evil demon overlord alien guy. And definitely not this high-school-level friendship talk from the good guys.

There’s been a few scummy decisions from the devs but honestly I could overlook most of them.

Using the terrible looking AI talking heads though? Awful. Why? It wouldn’t take much effort to just have a repeated talking animation just like most RTS have. It would look better, because the AI looks like shit, and it wouldn’t be AI.

All in all, 6/10 but AI usage is just a cherry on the awfulness. Maybe the game will be better in the future but right now it’s not worth it.",1754678403,2025-08-08 14:40:03

The races seem fun, and there are some nice quality of life improvements for rts such as the quick access to build units/buildings. If you got it for free and aren't playing the campaign I can see more of the appeal, but the price for every commander is a bit too high.

The story is good, visuals have improved drastically and unit sizing is looking better/more distinct, and game-play is coming to life and feeling crisper with better path finding.  One feature no one mentions that is great for new players or people who struggle with macro is their ""buddy bot"". Is it perfect? no- still needs some improving to iron out some kinds. Is it customisable to assist you? yes choose how much or little it assist you, anywhere from base expansions and worker creation and distribution to building a full army for you. it also show you have you should be expanding your base to some degree ie constanly building, having 1 working in production at base(s), getting that expansion base, getting a steady stream of combat units up. plus gives you more time to focus on micro and the combat aspect of the game, add as much or little or no support as you want. <-- This will help bridge the gap for new players or those who find the multi tasking too much.

steam,201708357,"Ok, so, this game apparently is a SC2-alike game that's based off a kickstarter that made over 2$million in kickstarter money.

It has some ex-SC2 and wc3 devs apparently working on it, and it DOES actually feel a fair bit like starcraft 2, in a pretty solid way. You can clearly feel which team members seem to be there, and which team members or capabilities/skillsets the team may have lost in being an entirely new team, with losing some of those blizzard employees who are obviously very skilled at their craft. 

The character/ship/environment modelling is quite good. And honestly, that's like 80% of what makes a game like this and like Starcraft 2 - good worldbuilding in the form of 3d modelling/assets, etc.

Some of the areas that are really rough and which don't really compare quality wise to SC2 are the avatars/in-game avatar animations when they're talking about things happening with the current mission. it's basically AI-generated slop - and like, older generation AI slop, which makes it worse. Like placeholder static art for some of the characters you're talking to, That said, most indie games are like this so it's not really a huge critique to have that in just some areas. But when it's there, it shows the difference between this game and SC2.

And the ship that acts as your base (at least in the first missions) is just .. basically crap. This may just be based partly on the fact that you can't zoom in, but it really does look pretty awful, like 2004 level quality. Maybe it was one of the first in game assets the team made, i'm not sure. Also, some of the characters in the early missions, on the ship, have just AWFUL voiceacting (it could be done by ai, but it's pretty hard to tell, it's just.. bad). Like you know when a game or a movie has characters or actors that just don't sound, look, or act like they fit the part/exist in that universe? The first missions have that.. in droves. The first few female voice actors, and the doctor. You'll see it when you see it.

I'm only about an hour and a bit in, and it's rough in patches. So far the worst bits (for me) are the really clunky camera controls. You have to really push your mouse to the screen edges for it to actually pan the camera left  and right, which might be good for some players but which personally really sucks. I think there should be a setting for ""edge of screen panning sensitivity"" and panning around with the mouse speed, it's FAR too slow panning around the map. And keybinds for a lot of things basically are completely broken. like if you try to rebind camera up/down/left/right from the arrow keys to say WASD, it just basically doesn't let you do that since those seem to be hardcoded keys for abilities that the game doesn't let you keybind -- an insanely awful flaw, since the game basically thinks it knows how you want to keypress better than you. and you can't rebind say building buildings or whatever to match starcraft like how other rts games often do - a pretty big weakness IMO. Also a lot of the missions and your ship/base area have locked camera zoom levels, which is quite annoying. even if you could zoom in and out a quite small amount would be very nice. The close zoom with the low detail level in the base is quite sucky.

With ALL of that said, it otherwise does feel like starcraft2 and there's a TON of potential. It IS fun.

I hope the team at frost giant well and hope they make a bunch of money. 

I would hope they fix the keybind issue, allow more camera zoom in/out, and maybe spend a bit of time redoing the initial ship that acts as a base, make it larger and less boring, and redo some of the voice acting. Have people at the studio ask people that they think sound good for a specific character if they would record some lines. Don't just use bad voice ai models or record yourself if your voice doesn't sound like it fits the character.

I would also recommend them to try selling or otherwise licensing their engine to other game companies so we see more RTS games in the same vein as SC2 - that's obviously what they're going for and they can make bucketloads of money from licensing. Right now SC2 and stormgate are the only major players in this space but they could make a lot off licensing the engine to other companies that have other ideas for RTS games. Would love to see an RTS made by paradox interactive or different studios with different takes on game design. 

There's almost no chance that anyone at the studio will read any of this but that's my opinion :) If anyone does, talk to your  ceo and try to get them to see how they could make a lot of money licensing the engine. :D",1754664372,2025-08-08 10:46:12
steam,201707976,"The campaign is very fun.  I'm impressed with how far the game play and story has come along since its initial early access period.  Graphics are decent, voice acting is solid, controls are very responsive.  The game play feels like a cross between starcraft 2's rapid pace and warcraft 3 where there is time to use unit/hero abilities more strategically. I don't like that the campaign is online only but I can live with it while I wait for them to make the promised offline mode.  I also don't like the microtransaction monetization model of this game but I think $25 is a fair price for what you get with the campaign and you can just buy it that way.  This game is substantially more complete at launch than others I've spent way more money on (looking at you civ 7) but there is work still to do.  I hope they continue to work hard on improving some of the remaining rougher areas (such as characters not interacting with you on the ship until you talk to an unrelated character, game pulling you out of story every chapter even if you bought all content already, etc.)   For those that care co-op and team-based multiplayer are still in development at time of writing.

steam,201701390,"After many years and hype stormgate is finally released. So how is it?

In one word - unfinished. It was released that is clearly still a beta build. Many features are not here and are promised in a future being put in ""sigma labs"" tab of a menu but with how game is doing we probably won't get them all and game will die in few months time. I wouldn't recommend investing money in it if you expect to get full experience that devs are promising is coming in upcoming years.

Said all that - it is still pretty fun game. Fundamentals are solid, gameplay is solid, just a bit rough around the edges. Writing this after finishing Vanguard campaign and it was a fun ride. Around 10h to finish it on brutal for a SC2 veteran. First half of a campaign was quite easy but from mission 7 it gets a lot tougher. Story is not amazing main complain being that villains are completely forgettable and not build very well. I finished campaign 5min ago I already can't remember their names. One event was head scratcher that happens right before last mission. It was build up as big deal but it had absolutely no impact on anything so I don't know why devs even included it? But gameplay was very solid, so if you are into mechanics and not story, you gonna have a good time. Overall for campaign I give 2/10 for story and 8/10 for gameplay. 

For 1v1 section, I can't say much. Were is just not enough people playing it and matches are not even. One game you can play a guy who has never played an rts game before and next one you get literally top 10 player of the competitive ladder and got stomped to the ground. Unless we get 1v1 player surge and mmr evens out ladder is pretty much unplayable because matches are just not fun, both if you stomp or you get stomped. But I like that macro portion of the game is a lot easier than sc2. For normal people it is a lot easier. Also were is no such thing as ""I didn't looked at my army for 1sec and now its all gone and game is lost"" as it is in sc2 and I think it's a much better thing. For casual rts players I would recommened stormgate over sc2 if we can get balanced matchmaking.

Biggest pro, full campaign, it works. The first 3 missions are free so feel free to give it a shot. So far the first one has been the worst as far as judging the difficulty for the rest of the campaign. Progress travels between missions similar to a mesh of SC2 with unit upgrades and WC3 hero upgrades and items.

""Okay this kinda a scam considering the actual Utitmate Edition does contain 1 more Hero.
Why did we waste money on this then.
So are we supposed to buy the Ultimate Edition now only for 1 more Hero?
Or buy it for 9€ in the ingame Store?

Also the second Infernal Hero which supposely is unlocked is a no-show to 1.0.""

People get early access on a cheaper price usually than fullprice cause the developer needs the money and the feedback.
Here we basicly bought into a F2P title and have less than the actual edition we bought for EA.

...But it didnt. As such, my expectations were much higher, coming from relatively well funded devs involved in SC2/WC3. Im considering both of those games truly top tier in terms of single player RTS campaign, and this was main reason i've been interested in the Stormgate. Credit for letting people play couple of first missions for free, i appreciate it. Unfortunately, based on those three free missions i can say this game simply dont deliver decent campaign experience. It cannot really compare to either Starcraft of Warcraft in terms of quality, storytelling, worldbuilding, memorable characters... Maybe it gets better further down the lane, but ""demo"" didnt convince me enough to open my wallet. On top of that value proposition here is simply poor - full campaign consisting of 12 missions is 21 pounds. Not bad... If we ignore the fact that each mission can be beaten within 15-30 mins. so yeah, 21 pounds for 4-5 hours of gameplay, + co-op commanders for 7,50 EACH on top of that...

The permanent upgrade choices you get to do to your units between missions is a really cool feature that I had forgotten about from SC2.

steam,201684232,"What I've played so far:

Missions 1-3 (Brutal)
1v1 - 10 games (Vanguard)

My Thoughts:
Campaign has been enjoyable so far despite some wonky transitions, Missions 1-3 on brutal felt pretty easy, though there was a large difficulty spike towards the end of mission which was a bit odd (not that I minded). A lot of the dialogue is cheesy, and the animated portraits while the characters speak are a bit jarring.

1v1 so far has been decently fun as a hardcore SC2 ladder grinder, but rollback is a massive problem and has hurt my enjoyment a little bit.

Overall I'd give Missions 1-3 a 8/10, and 1v1 a 6/10 (partly because of rollback, also matchmaking is a bit off)
I've bought Missions 4-10 and plan to update my review later

So far, I'd say it's at least worth a try",1754631713,2025-08-08 01:41:53

While there is clearly still work to be done, the visuals are greatly improved, the pathing actually feels crisp and snappy now, and I'm enjoying the music. They've also released a map editor.

Try it out, it's free anyway

(Not neurotypical, i mean things literaly if somehow it sounds like it's not)

I think there is a lot to do with what is there, recent updates have been huge jumps forward again and again 

I really like how this game uniquely makes the genra more accessible but keeps the skill ceiling. 
The pace is faster than before i'd say it's a nice rythm, but it's not overwhelming and leaves place for more micro-management of the units and strategy

I'd say it's awesome to learn rts, but it's also made quite a bit of ink flow amongst old school people which doesn't surprise me, it is a passion project

I think at this point it went from promising to pretty fun as it is, although it is still awating more content, which makes me very interested in what is next considering the latest developments (that infernal rework was awesome, really interested in the future celestials!)

The team has listened to their community a lot, many things have changed in ways that correspond to what was asked by players, and i don't think i remember changes that weren't pointed as good, although expectations and criticism go further than that

About the recent campaign, ashes of earth, i haven't done it all yet but for someone who's less interested in the humans i feel invested, the mood is pretty epic and the characters are fun to use. I wouldn't mind a slight supplement of polish in the between missions hub but i'm not really complaining either, i'm already surprised about how much i care about the vanguard's story now

Bonus points for the editor and what the players will make of it, they haven't implemented more than the basic tools and people have already made a moba, wow

All in all, still a work in progress considering how many gamemodes are on the menu but i feel like we're leaving the realm of ""it could become good"" to reach ""what's there is good, we just need more""

The characters are distinct, though I can't say well written with only 3 missions to go off of. 

The real downside is the monetization.

A 12 mission campaign for $25, especially when the existing 3 missions take just over an hour to full clear? A cash shop on a game this early in its life-cycle? Hero unlocks via cash shop?

After over 2,000 hours of playtime spent in Starcraft, as well as my youth with Warcraft, I can say it's worthy of the title. It brings many Gameplay improvements that I'd rather miss more in an RTS.

[list]
    [*]Managing buildings and unit production with the keyboard is easier than ever.
    [*]The level of hotkey customization is something I've never experienced in a game before.
    [*]The automatic assignment of control groups also makes life much easier.
    [*]A Buddy Bot, which is also fully customizable and can help with economics or unit training.

The developers put a lot of thought into how to make the game easier for newcomers while still not making it boring for pro players.

I can't understand the many negative reviews. The game doesn't deserve that.
Compared to Starcraft 2, many seem to forget that Wings of Liberty didn't have a co-op mode back then, and other features were only added gradually.
And it wasn't even free to play.

I understand that many are dissatisfied with the game's funding model. I think Frostgiant is trying their best, though.
Financing yourself these days won't be easy. Unfortunately, Uncapped Games, another studio in Blizzard's RTS division, seems to have had similar difficulties implementing a viable funding model with their also very good game Battle Aces and had to abandon their game.

I hope Frostgiant doesn't suffer the same fate. The game itself doesn't deserve to be shut down.

My problem is the way players are treated. The game is way too expensive for how much it offers (only 12 campaign missions and a few co-op commanders).

The characters were cardboard cutouts, their dialogue was bland to the point of discomfort, the voice acting was flat, the mission designs were generic even ten years ago, and the gameplay was not fun. Units blobbed, unit designs felt uninspired, and the whole thing looked rough.

That’s fine. It’s still early access. Right?

Four missions into the 1.0 release and I have to decide whether I complete the campaign and hope it gets better, or just write Stormgate off and accept that I paid for a dream. Not all dreams come true.

I cannot recommend Stormgate. Other rival projects have had far less funding, have far less prestigious laurels for their roster, far less RTS experience – yet they are substantially more advanced in both completion status and overall quality. Immortal Gates of Pyre? ZeroSpace? Beyond All Reason? Follow those.

In time I might expand on this review. But for now, I’ll keep it basic.

Units are bland – abilities, animations, visual design, and dialogue. They’re not interesting to use – which is so out-of-character for the team who created the literal gold standard in the Craft games. To this day, I still quote Starcraft unit dialogue! Every RTS unit is compared to those and how they felt to use. Stormgate’s units are not cut from the same cloth and certainly not by the same shears.

Sound feels poorly mixed and the effects are the utmost basic. I haven’t even noticed the soundtrack, except for when I turned it down to try to actually hear the unit dialogue. The art style is between uninspired and outright bland. Units don’t actually control all that well – they have a horrible tendency to clump. What ever happened to all those blogs about pathfinding and control? Starcraft 2 units feel like they clump less. I guess these are kind of similar to Starcraft 1 clumping? Instead, play Beyond All Reason and learn what fantastic unit control looks like in practice. 

But the thing that’s really killing me? The campaign story is essentially non-existent. Yeah, it’s there. But you don’t want to engage with it. It’s boring to the point that cleaning your sink has more drama and intrigue. The first few missions are so poorly designed that I’m having to go out of my way to consider what the developers were trying to achieve with each one. In contrast? Starcraft I’m half-way through the campaign before I even stop to think about that. Even then I get distracted by the dialogue, the story beats, just enjoying using my units and watching their animations. Warcraft 3? No time to think – I want to load that next mission!

There is no manual save in campaign. Yeah, sorry.

As for co-op? Just play Starcraft 2. No, really. It’s in better shape, despite being left to rot.

I hoped Stormgate could give me an experience similar to the old Blizzard RTS. I would have been happy with a fun time, even if it didn't top the old. I enjoyed Tempest Rising, even if it didn't make me feel how the old C&C games did. But Stormgate? I'm just not enjoying myself.

steam,201621786,"Veteran StarCraft and SC2 player here. Try it, since it is free. Can't really downvote a free game.

[h1]It is so bad though, that I had to write an essay about how bad it is.[/h1]

Just tried it with the ""full release"" and all.

[h2]Units[/h2]

The units lack any kind of character. Everything feels samey. Fights were just a big mess.

Sure you can micro a bunch and stutter your ranged boys or move the rocket cars around, but it never feels satisfying. What units do I even wanna snipe? Even if you are a noob in SC2. Once you see that High Templar storm your bio army you know whats what. And you get excited to try to play around it. This kinda thing never happened for me here.

In most RTS you can mostly guess what a unit does when you look at it. In this game it is just variations of dude with gun. The rocket cars really did not look like they would launch a bunch of rockets. Everything else is just man with gun.

I tried the humans first, but when you see the other races, it is even more of a mess. You don't really get exited to try out any unit. I don't even know how you make a game this sophisticated and still so boring.
It is honest to god a peace of art in that regard.

And the strange unit design. I really don't get it. Why are the spaceships smaller than your infantry men? Makin a big *** Battlecruiser feels fun since you get a big *** Battlecruiser that can make a big bang, but here you get a Tinycruiser for toddlers that moves odd.

[h2]Sound[/h2]

It is basically nonexistent. Just take the Siege Tank copy for example. The real Siege Tank make a big boom and it is so satisfying watching them obliterate enemy armies. And that satisfying sound is a big part of it. The copy just looks like some beetle water-cannon that lobs orbs with barely a noise. They still did some big hits, but it just doesn't feel right without any meaningful noise. That very distinct noise also is a good indicator for the enemy by the way. These things matter is what I am trying to say.
This of course applies to so many other units. Nothing has a distinct sound. Try to remember the gun noise of any unit after playing. You won't be able to. It is all the same. 

[h2]Game[/h2]

I can't say anything of value about the balancing and game design in general, since I really could not get myself to play for long enough. The magic sauce seems to be missing is all I am going to say.

[h2]Story/World[/h2]

And what I saw on YouTube about the campaign was some of the saddest story writing and voice acting.
Tychus telling you that it is about damn time gets you more exited than this whole story-line. Generic evil guys and Marvel jokes. I couldn't care less about this world. So sad.

Anyways, beat a few AIs. Got bored. Not going to touch it again. That's it.",1754554757,2025-08-07 04:19:17
steam,201620824,"Been playing this game since the early alpha, and I've seen just about as much of its developing process as the general public can. I've also been in the alpha of several other RTS games that are (or were) in development at the same time. (I won't say which ones.) Before this, I played StarCraft 1 and 2 for a good many years. I love RTS games, especially blizzard style ones, so I will be simultaneously needlessly harsh, and strongly biased. Take my perspective with a corresponding grain of salt.  

Of all the games in development that I played over the last couple years, this one always felt the most natural to play. Early on, I had a lot of minor complaints. It felt like ""StarCraft 3 with a new skin"", at first. Nothing more, nothing that made it more interesting or more unique, except for a few solid quality of life changes for ease of play. The campaign felt copy/paste and uninspired, and was full of minor but noticable flaws. The art style, admittedly, didn't appeal to me either, but I was willing to let that slide. Still, though, of all the games I was testing, this one felt the best when it came to actual gameplay. Unit responses were snappy enough, and the balance between passive and active abilities was comfortable for my preferences. I put the most hours into this, because despite my complaints, I had the most fun. The other games may have had more revolutionary concepts and ideas, but this one just... felt more natural. Less time getting used to the UI, less time needed to master each faction's main mechanics, and more time simply playing the game and having fun. 

Fast forward a year or so in development. Everything that I had a major complaint about has been rectified.
The gameplay improvements? Solid. Still feels similar to SC2 in many ways, as one might expect from its spiritual successor, but now it actually feels like its own distinct game. Building on it over the course of the Alpha, the devs have taken a reskinned clone and made it into something that can actually stand on its own two feet, proudly at that. 
The Campaign? Rewritten to be far more interesting. Admittedly, it still feels like I can sum up the depth of each character with one or two words each so far, but the world feels a lot more interesting now, so I actually feel invested this time. Simplicity isn't a bad thing, either, especially if they find interesting ways to subvert expectations (but still keep the characters true to themselves) later on. 
The art style? Redone, and in my opinion it's much, much better. 

It took awhile to get on its feet, but if you're still on the fence, I recommend giving it a try. It's still a work in progress as I write this, substantial improvements are still being made, but I honestly feel like it's absolutely worth playing in its current state. If you liked playing StarCraft II, or if you were frustrated with some recent-ish high profile RTS games where the unit control felt awkward and clumsy, pick up Stormgate. I firmly believe that, as of right now, it is my favorite RTS on the market. There are other games in development that do things that are more uniquely interesting and more revolutionary, and I am extraordinarily excited for them, but if you want to sit down and have fun? This game feels solid. It feels like it knows exactly what it wants to do, and does it well, consistently. And there's more to come! 

Give Stormgate a try. Support the Devs! I hope to play this game for many more years.",1754553037,2025-08-07 03:50:37

The dialogue is cringe worthy, and this is coming from a guy that watches anime and has to forgive quite bit to enjoy it.

steam,201617409,"If you paid money for this, you were ripped off. Even as a free game, Stormgate doesn’t feel like a finished product. The fact that this is considered a “full release” — despite the developers openly stating they’re still actively working on it — just feels wrong. It plays like an early access title, and if I feel that way now, I can only imagine how Kickstarter backers or early access players must have felt before now.

Overall, the game feels like a budget StarCraft II with a splash of Warcraft III. That said, it does show potential. The factions are different enough from SC2 that it doesn’t feel like a direct clone, and there are signs of thoughtful design, especially in the base-building mechanics. For example, you don’t need control groups for production buildings anymore — constructing units and upgrades is streamlined and can be done from anywhere more easily. Worker units are smart enough to return to mining after building without micromanagement. These quality-of-life improvements are genuinely well done.

But ultimately, those well-designed systems can’t compensate for how shallow the rest of the game feels. Stormgate might become something great over time, but in its current state, I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone except someone specifically looking for a new free RTS. And given that StarCraft II is also free-to-play now, I’d still recommend SC2 over Stormgate unless you’re simply bored of it. I will gladly come back and update my review as changes are made, but in it's current state I do not recommend the game. That said I truly hope the developers continue to flesh it out, there's great potential and I would love to see a new great RTS.",1754546689,2025-08-07 02:04:49
steam,201616859,"I'll certainly join a Co-op if my friends want to play it, but after having finished the Vanguard Campaign, I can't help but feel cheated. Hero Inventories are too small for how many items they throw at you, some upgrades feel far too expensive for their own good, and the last two missions were absolutely horrendous designs that needed far more play-testing than was given.

[spoiler]The second to last mission is an escort mission: The entire map is a death field except for your movable command center. It cannot carry workers, and demands you to disassemble all buildings when you move your outpost. This includes your supply depots, but the mission has a default value of 100 supply instead of the true cap of 300, meaning when you camp at the final base, the smartest idea is to max out your army with Carriers. Why Carriers? because later into the mission, there are (at least, I was playing on Beginner) two Infernals that spawn extremely out of the way (like, 1/4th of the map level of distance) and prevent the objective from progressing, but if you leave to go kill them, Infernals will attack and kill the objective. Better hope you built Carriers because nothing else can survive the trek to them and back. Oh, and if you're supply-capped because you built Carriers earlier and your workers died, you can only repair the main objective with consumables you get from other missions.[/spoiler]

[spoiler]The last mission is a Death March. Aside from an awkward barrier set up in the top left corner to prevent you from progressing (points to the bad guys for putting the batteries outside of your range for the first time in Gaming History) you're expected to attack towards the top right of the map. All the while, you are being absolutely POUNDED by the heaviest units in the game. Being on Beginner however, I didn't have much problems killing them. There's also a lot of resources on the way, which leave you a sitting duck, but can also help you rebuild your forces. When you can have three maxed-out bases worth of resources, you'd think the best idea would be to make a 300 max supply army right? Well on Beginner, the mission ended when I actually got to the Top Right. I wasted half an hour building a 300 supply Carrier Army for absolutely nothing. I'll note this mission ALSO has 100 base supply, AND requires researching unit upgrades... On a Death March...[/spoiler]

I also had the false assumption that there'd be some kind of NG+ when I completed the campaign... like, I'd get to keep all of my upgrades and farm credits for everything I didn't get, essentially bringing new replayability. I saw no such option, which to be fair was my own illusioned expectation, but I'll note it anyway.",1754545641,2025-08-07 01:47:21
steam,201615180,"As a long time fan and player of popular Blizzard RTS games, I have been waiting and hoping that someone would develop an RTS that scratches that same itch that Blizzard has left lingering in the community for a long time!

Unfortunately, after a really disappointing Early Access release, and a still disappointing ""Launch but not launch I guess???"" I've found that I am still waiting.

I really wanted Stormgate to knock my socks off, but now it feels like the game is a cash grab for backers and for those that will spend money in their store, which should not be in the game right now anyway. Frost Giant keeps emphasizing on the fact that they have a really really long time until the game will be ready for launch, if this is the case, I think they need to take this off the storefront and complete the damn thing first, then release it...

After the updates, there are slightly improved graphics, the environments are still bland and not super exciting or creative, character model changes, and some other little things here and there. I can appreciate that the B.O.B.'s are gone and replaced with a new harvester unit, the B.O.B.'s just felt so dumb and out of place. The game feels a little more serious, and that's a positive thing.

Stormgate is not the RTS that scratches that itch. Frost Giant has really screwed up on this from the get go, first impressions matter, and their first impression when putting this game into our hands absolutely soils their reputation. It feels akin to Back 4 Blood touting that it was developed by the creators of Left 4 Dead, then they just couldn't live up to their past projects... I'm sure many people will do the same as me, and just wait and watch. I have other games to play that actually keep my interest.

I really want this game to be great, but it sure as hell isn't there yet. Don't buy anything in this game, and don't purchase anything other than the Free To Play version, it's sooooooo not worth the money you'd give them.",1754542689,2025-08-07 00:58:09

The game is super responsive and it feels gooood to play, it's even more responsive than SC2. The engine is great too. However faction are lacking of units but I assume those will come later. The basis is great but FrostGiant will have to continue their effort to offer a complete and amazing game.

steam,201612313,"It's a fine game. So far, nothing really especially attracts RTS gamers aside from the snowplay engine. However, potential is still there. It seems they have been forced into this ""under-cooked"" release due to monetary/sponsor issues. Right now, everything aside from the campaign is still ""under-cooked"" by a significant margin.

For fans of RTS single player experiences and $25 isn't much to ask, I think the campaign is still worth it for you to play. Otherwise, keep this game in the back of your mind for the future (Probably minimum 6 months). Some notable future features:

1v1 - This is *mostly* complete. I can not say it's complete until they are finished with their design for the celestial faction. However, it is servicable at the moment.
Stormgates - Hence the game title, this is a feature in 1v1 which is an ""upgrade"" to the creep system. Very rough right now, but it has potential.
Editor - They have invested quite a bit of time into the editor. It seems like it still needs a bit of work, but soon the community can develop loads of cool custom/arcade games.
Co-op - This seems to be far out (~6 months to a year) atm for their official re-vamp. But, assuming they don't screw it up, this will be the closest to an ""upgrade"" and ""still-serviced"" co-op mode from SC2. It is also 3-player, which may fit some people's niche.
3v3 - Their yet-to-be-revealed Moba-esque-but-still-RTS pvp mode. This likely going to be released around the same time or soon after the Co-op re-vamp. The most uncertain mode so far, but also the area where they likely have the most freedom to innovate.

Edit: After reading other's reviews, I have come to the conclusion maybe 60% of the negative reviews should be on the paid game-editions (Basic, Deluxe, and Ultimate editions, translated from their respective kickstarter backer rewards) -- and understandably so. The developers over-promised and under-delivered on what they put out there upon the announcement of Stormgate. The extra (read: discounted) content in the kickstarter backer rewards was/is mostly aimed at the Co-op heroes, which currently do not have release-ready content and likely won't for at least months!

Right now, any of the higher-tier edition upgrades are a BAD DEAL. It's a free game to try out. Really, the only question at the moment should be if the $25 campaign is worth it for you.",1754537937,2025-08-06 23:38:57
steam,201611595,"Out of nine of the twelve missions I've played 9 were enjoyable, from what I've seen of 1v1 it looks good there may need to be some balance patches from what I've seen I have not tried yet.

Glad they kept it up its forming into the game we all wished for!

Above is positive review below is what the game feels like after some more time.

1v1 - cant get behind or feel a connection to any unit just have more than the enemy and a-move for victory. All other RTS games you can make a connection to units as they are good at what they are meant for. Stormgate is the opposite just make anything and swarm them healing is way to strong.

Campaign - last three missions were meh at best the entire story was OK but couldn't relate to anyone and all the ""heroes"" didn't feel like they cared about what was happening in the game or cared too much to the point of cringe. If you want to learn the lore you actually have to load up the mission and are playing a mission just selecting upgrades for units progressing the story, there was a time where the game was the game and you select unit upgrades maybe play a mini game before actually starting a mission. When talking to people in the campaign you lose control whenever you click on someone which doesn't center the camera to where you are.

There are more issues that I am not stating as it will take too long to write out all my gripes with the game, but I will state the graphics has VASTLY improved but are still not perfect.

They need to put this back in the oven before coming to early access, if they released this game in this current state last year and spent another year fixing all the issues with this current release I would have hope for this game, instead this is the ""release"" which is extremely lack luster.

And as someone who has been playing SC2 1v1 and 2v2 for the past decade, this game offers a new take on the competitive mode. Stormgates are AWESOME and introduce just enough randomness into a skill based mode to elevate it to a new level.

Don't listen to people here who say that they supported this game on Kickstarter and are now being scammed because they only received the first 3 campaign missions. Let me tell you as someone who ALSO supported this game on Kickstarter, each support tier's rewards were clearly spelled out. People who only have access to the first set of missions only bought the first set of missions...

The monetization strategy in this game is totally fair. You can buy the full campaign, access to the Coop commanders (for a mode that is very much still a WIP), and cosmetics. The devs need to be able to make money to continue to support the game and build out new features. Everything available to purchase is priced fairly and well worth it in my opinion.

steam,201593115,"Aug 05: Bought the $32CAD basic edition to play the campaign, and somehow this only includes 1/3 of 1/3 (missions 4-6 of just the Vanguard race) of the campaign. Literally 3 extra missions for $32. Mistake on my end I guess for not reading the fine print, but when there are multiple axis of paid content (the options in Steam versus In-Game are different) for a game like this.... just wow. For the quality of what you get, I was already considering $32CAD to be generous for one third of campaign, but this is predatory slop. In reality, it's $39CAD for just the Vanguard campaign at a minimum and there are tons of ticky-tack extras that you can pay more for. The 'recommended, basic bundle' is anything but. 

I expected better from a studio who marketed themselves as making a spiritual successor to StarCraft II.

edit (Aug 11, 2025) -- noting that the monetization was completely changed 48h after launch, with no compensation for folks like myself who burned and beta tested the live game with real money. Neato!",1754511650,2025-08-06 16:20:50

steam,201588192,"I've played since day 1 of early access. Here's the plain and simple of this product as of 8/7/25.

- It's $25 for the Vangard (human) campaign (first 3 missions are free to try).
- 1v1 PvP is free to play.
- 3 Player Co-Op is incomplete. 

My review of the campaign is a rough around the edges Sci-fi RTS campaign. There's better, but not the worst.
Game performance is also all over the place. 
Co-op hasn't changed since its launch last year. Don't bother with Co-Op. Go play SC2 or SC2 custom co-op.

If you enjoyed SC2 and wanted to explore another similar game, Stormgate is a rougher and less polished experience. If you can look past that, you'll enjoy your time with the product. If you're not okay with it then continue to play the RTS game(s) you love.

Bad performance on a high end PC, frame rates are embarrassing. Most game modes are still just in development. They are charging 10 bucks for every 3 additional campaign missions and Frost Giants whole business strategy is just to micro transaction every little piece and bit of this game.

steam,201587328,"A huge disappointing way to 1.0

Stormgate is a title I've backed since the beginning and played all the releases since 0.1 to 0.4. However I can't recommend that game at all in the state of 1.0 (they left the Early Access so a review can be done)

- First of all, that 1.0 is not the 1.0 most of the people think. It's the 0.6 version but Frost Giant decided to make a huge leap from 0.5 to 1.0
- The content in 1.0 is abysmal and not worth the investment. You have only 12 single player missions from Vanguard faction, 1v1 ladder and that's all. No coop at all but of course, Coop Commanders can be still bought with a promise of finishing the Coop
- For a price of 65$ you get only 10 hours of Single Player content. These twelve missions will take you less than 10 hours to complete a campaign.

However, the biggest offender for me to not support this game anymore is Frost Giant's practices towards the consumers. They treat them like bottomless pits of money.
- The leap from 0.5 to 1.0 was a weird move with hope to get as many players as possible for a full launch while in reality it's the 0.6 from old roadmap
- Devs (including their CEO) were writing fake positive reviews, but got caught
- Ninja Kickstarter quick edits to change some information to avoid being caught with false premises
- Such one promise for example was an exclusive access to the beta in 2024. Just before the beta, Frost Giant decided to throw the beta access for on STEAM, for a price cheaper than those backed it on Kickstarter
- Really poor communication and confusion with bundles. Which one should people buy to get full access to the campaign

Also, please don't use Early Access to start it with tech demos without content. 0.1 had the highest amount of players and it scared away many people for good because how just empty that version was. In 2-3 hours you were able to see the whole content. Seeing how short that game is in 1.0 release, no wonder it does not have many people.",1754505639,2025-08-06 14:40:39

steam,201585449,"Every aspect of this game feels like it was made with arrogance that hit a reality wall. Like a studio that saw themselves as AAA and didn't care the resources weren't there to support it. Everything could have been a lot better if they had been smarter, leaner, and more focused. Some examples.

--Very little explained in tutorial or UI. Honestly, without having played Starcraft, how would anyone know what Supply Blocked means? Or how about explaining that not all units can target flying enemies? Who wants to essentially softlock themselves in a match by needing to learn-as-they-play? Who wants to spend time researching units before they actually play? (Some, but not enough to sustain a healthy playerbase.)
--Top-tier actors (Simu Lu, Matt Mercer, etc.), try their best to jazz up a bland story of confusing characters, and typos all over the place, often with weird bouncing animations on the talking heads and out-of-proportion conversations.
--Major bugs (e.g. boss had 0 HP and when dying wouldn't trigger the final cutscene.)

The MOBA took over from the RTS because the MOBA concentrated multiple branches of mechanics into a single type of combat that was simple-to-understand but hard-to-master. This game could have taken a similar approach of simple gameplay with complex decisions, but the game focused on nostalgic/outdated designs instead. I think in their ex-Blizzard arrogance, they strove for AAA goals with very little thought on how to adapt for an indie budget or modern tastes. Sometimes people fail upwards.

I bought the basic version of this game for 24.99 thinking I was getting all the missions.  Instead I got 3 missions and a ""hero"" for a game mode that isn't even complete.  I can't get a refund because of my playtime from early access.  Feels like I got scammed.",1754502720,2025-08-06 13:52:00
steam,201584373,"So this is an update to my initial review which was as follows:

""Great can absolutely recommend! I first took a look at this about a year ago in early access and it felt clunky and not optimized. Now I'm 2 missions into the campaign and having a blast - feels really great!""

Since then, I have purchased the campaign and coop commanders and played about 14 hours in total. 

Campaign:
Pros
- Starts of really strong and is also what got me hooked into buying the rest of the campaign
- Heros with interesting skills and equipment, Tech and research tree in the base hub, good voice acting and characters
Cons
- Ball of death can always win, you never need to use special unites which you just acquired to complete missions
- no tutorialisation of what buildings or unites you have or against what unites you are fighting against - I still have no clue what enemy unites or buildings there are, I just need to send in my ball of death and destroy them.
- Later on some missions are just annoying and not fun. Spoiler! [spoiler] Mission Dead Reckoning with the contamination zone just feels really tedious and annoying. Always having to wait for the drones to give you a safe area from the radiation. Also you need to explore and salvage resources but have to wait for the drone cool down from the command center. Also need to move your base with all unites close to it to other resource sites and it moves really slow. [/spoiler] 
- Upgrades from the techlab does not really feel impactful. The Research station uses the same currency which is a shame   as one could use research knowledge and the tech lab could use credits or tech scraps. You have to play the campaign more than once to unlock everything. I like having to decide how to have to spend limited resources, but the decisions are not impactful. Way would I want to play a story campaign several times to unlock everything? 
- campaign kind of really drops of towards the end and was somewhat forgetful, and the last missions felt like ""okay I bought this so I’ll finish it""

Coop:
- difficulty has no real impact, ball of death wins in almost every case no matter if hard Brutal or annihilation.
- Hero upgrades don't seem really impactful. When levelling sc2 commanders in coop i would often really anticipate unlocking certain skills at certain levels, but here it just has little impact. 
- I like the idea of hero equipment and loadouts, but since it has little to no impact why would i care?
- Coop with three players is a nice change, but 2 player coop would be nice as well. Finding a coop buddy in sc2 was really nice but having to plan for three people is just again - tedious

I really want to like this game, it has  some really nice ideas, but as of now it just does not expand on them enough and just feels a bit boring :(",1754502481,2025-08-06 13:48:01

steam,201580622,"imma keep it real with no dickriding or glazing, I have been following the progress of this game since its announcement, and I must say that, despite the rough early access launch last year, the game has made some improvements. The developers are actively working to fix past mistakes and are listening to player feedback, which has greatly contributed to the game's current state compared to a year ago. Although some promised features are still missing, I believe that if the developers maintain this level of consistent progress for another year, the game will reach its full potential. In the meantime, I encourage you to try the first three campaign missions and experience the three races in a 1v1, AI skirmish, or cooperative mode. This is all available for free, so you can get a feel for the game without any obligation. If you don’t feel that special connection to the game right now, it might be worth stepping away and checking back after a couple of patches (which are released every two months).

steam,201578908,"Story is really bad, the dialogue somehow is worse. If an A.I was asked to write a dialogue between teenagers working somewhere it would be better than the script the game has. The visuals are pretty however the designs for units, heros and buildings is bland and lazy. There are a couple of useful control features you can customize which might be helpful to some but the gameplay itself is boring and nothing compared to what it tries to be, Starcraft.

>This is not a spoiler since it's the opening cinematic for the campaign<

A group of humans survive and escape the ""hell"" gate opening on Earth, rebuild their forces in 15 years to liberate it. And they return and keep repeating ""we were not prepared to what was waiting for us"" ""we did not expect it to be like this"". yes they did not do any research, did not probe or scout, they just YOLO back in and the first thing you have to do is go back to a facility where there was a ""key"" and bring it back, not knowing if said facility exists anymore after 15 years or even thinking the key would still be there because it's important. I really need not say more on how little thought went into the plot and I do not want to go into the cringe, awful dialogue there is.

The only partial saving grace the game has is the visuals which aren't that bad but most of the units and buildings feel like placeholder objects and unfinished, to sum it up they look bland and boring. Not to mention the hero units look at best acceptable for a mobile card game.

I think these soo called ""ex-Blizz"" devs were the guys cleaning the toilets and wanted some free good will cash further sabotaging any good will people might have to actual good projects.",1754496764,2025-08-06 12:12:44

We got the early version of the campaign and it was laughably bad graphically, poorly written, and a second rate clone of Warcraft 3. The general game design was boring af for the individual levels too, you just sit there spamming units and a-move, no micro or anything required. So now we get this newer reworked version of the game and hey at least Infernal APPEARS to be playable, they gave their units speed buffs and seemed to have generally increased their damage as a whole which is nice.

The campaign is still a piece of shit, again poorly written, some very obvious and awkward exposition dumps for world building. The main character is boring, she's just a ""good person"" and they force you to sit through these boring ""gameplay sections"" where for some reason you have to keep going back to your main base and talk to NPCs instead of doing what you wanna do in an RTS game. You know, at least in SC2 it's a faster process just clicking through sub-screens in your hub base and you can ignore most NPC interactions if you want to. In here they make you walk from one room to the next.Again, storyline is a knock off of WC3, clearly cloning the arthas becoming corrupt storyline. Also this games over-reliance on esports and starcraft nostalgia is seriously fucking old now. I love starcraft but this game has no identity of its own, and the constant callbacks are tiring. They even do this disgusting animated portrait for main characters in the campaign where it's OBVIOUSLY AI GENERATED and appears to be calling back to SC1 animated portraits with the psuedo-crt look and delayed mouth movements that are poorly synced to the voice acting. It looks like shit and I can't take my eyes off it when it happens, i don't even know what's going on in the game because im so scared mom please help me im stuck balls deep in uncanny valley.

1) Unit pathing is atrocious you still have to micromanage every step, they get stuck in dumb places too
2) groups don't maintain cohesion or formation, so your group end up devolving into a useless line were faster units sprint away so you end up with weak ranged units engaging the enemy on the front because they ran faster and getting killed waaay before your heavy units get to the engagement.
3) Unit concept makes no sense, you have a ravaged planet yet you have.. dogs... which run super fast and die first because of 1 and 2
4) Having to run around inside the ship between missions, small nitpick but it's a time waster, specially when apart from the ""objective"" there's absolutely no interaction save for background animations.

Like others have said, feels like a bad reskin of SC

As a big fan of RTS especially Warcraft III, this brought me back to the Frozen Throne Night Elf campaign, blinking everywhere trying to find all the secrets. 

Its free so I would highly recommend any RTS fan, especially WC3/SC2 fans to give it a go. Why not?! The game play is smooth, unit designs are interesting and they've got some cool UI features like the hotkey/command card setup. 

Now the negative. I've only played 51 minutes in the campaign, and I've already been disconnected twice! Oddly both times were when I was running around the ship (the hub where you select your missions and item load out etc.). I'll give them the benefit of the doubt as the game just got released, but if I was playing PVP and getting disconnected frequently, that would definitely be a deal breaker.

Looking forward to playing more and the other factions' campaigns!

Edit: 15 Oct 2025 - Coming back two months later to update my review. At the time of my initial review, I hadn't realised only the first three campaign missions were free and you had to pay to unlock the rest of the campaign. While the first three missions were fun and scratched my Blizzard-RTS-itch, it wasn't so good or new and revolutionary that it kind of just made me want to play the SC2 campaign again (for free) rather than buy theirs (which is super expensive, at least here in NZ!). I'd still recommend RTS fans try it out, but with so many good games out there, I don't personally see myself spending much more time on this game unless some huge update or campaign price drop happens.",1754472142,2025-08-06 05:22:22
steam,201556649,"I played this game for about 30 minutes, the first mission was fun, after that it crashed and everytime I try to reload now, the aspect ratio is way off, for the menu screen I seem to be zoomed into the top left corner, with no way to access the menu to even quit the game.
Seems to have several bugs that need to be worked out.   I had been considering buying it if it were fun enough.  I like the concept, very similar to Starcraft.  Vanguard (Terrans) must fight against the Infernals (obvious Zerg stand-in) I haven't seen them yet but Celestials sound a lot like Protoss.
Get it and try the free portion of the game, maybe it won't crash for you.  Right now, I can't do anything with this but it would be nice to know they'd patched some things and corrected some errors, because errors like this after the first mission are a bad sign, portending low quality.

I even asked my friends to support it as there were not (at the time) good RTS anymore on offer. I got it mostly for the campaign as i really miss the SC approach to it and i hoped Stormgate can deliver - it's not even close.

Now we got insulted a second time now when they released an Ultimate Pack that has far more content than the original KS Ultimate Pack has. No mention whether or not the original KS will get attributed the new pack or not.

At this point doesnt even matter if they do attribute it to us, the trust is lost.

steam,201548312,"Bought into the early access, they just released the campaign.

AI portraits for all character dialogue in mission that look horrible. I only was given access to 1 chapter despite being an early pledger. asking me 200kr or 20 dollars to buy the next 2 chapters to finish the campaign that I was led to believe I was getting the entirety of for being an early pledger.

the missions were fun but this business practice is not something I can in any way support. I'll probably keep playing the multiplayer as it's free but I am beyond disappointed with frost giant studios for this insane choice for the campaign. having chapters in installments might sound more consumer friendly but it only really serves to frustrate people who pledged in early whilst cutting up the story in ways that might be jarring for some people.

On the actual story though, it's not good. Matthew mercer can only really carry a script so far. the actual plot isn't like bad, but the dialogue is so painfully bad and full of sci fi cliches. These are supposed to be the people who made starcraft. Why the hell is the dialogue so stiff and stinted when starcraft was so insanely well written.",1754454567,2025-08-06 00:29:27

Unit upgrades like the Starcraft 2 campaign are in, hero units are interesting and useful.  This is way better than I was expecting after first playing it last year. 

Last point I want to make it just how great the ""game feel"" is - practically matches or even exceeds Starcraft 2.  And that is high, high praise.

Early access was rough. Questionable art direction,  mechanics that were simply not fun, janky unit movements and lag issues in an RTS...
But then again, IT WAS Early access. Yes, maybe a little bit to early but here are the results now. They listened to feedback and made the changes that were necessary. 
Art direction now is darker, more mature and in line with what you expect from SC2 devs
Got rid of the annoying creeps camps and replaced with  way more interesting storm gates that spawn randomly, giving you an incentive to get on the map
Unit movement an pathing y sooo much better, not perfect, there is some work still to be done here but its really good.
No lag, delay or anything like that, really smooth experience.
Focusing on the campaign and 1v1 was a tough but a correct call. Lets just hope that the missed first step did not kill the chances of this great game to live on!

It clearly needed a lot of work at the time but I did enjoy the 1v1, which is my main interest in the game anyways. I mostly wrote the game off after a while, but when they revamped their team and brought in a new art director, there was a glimmer of hope. Upon this release, I have to say I'm impressed with the changes they've made.

The engine is excellent and you can tell they put a lot of time and effort into it. The race design has improved significantly, and I appreciate that Infernals have become menacing, while the changes to Celestial mechanics were necessary. The game runs well on Ultra settings even on my now long-in-the-tooth PC. The actual Stormgate mechanic replacing the creep camps makes for much more engaging gameplay. 

Balance will be figured out over time and I'm sure many tweaks will be made. I can see myself sinking some time into this game, which I would not have said a year ago.",1754452542,2025-08-05 23:55:42

Personally that's the key determining factor on if I can really get into a game or not, and why despite how ""good"" a free to play game is, It will never get much of my time or respect. 

A. The fact that you'll never own it and it can be shut down or taken away at any moment is an astronomical downside.
B. Free to play game's are synonymous with anti-consumer practices. crushing immersion with greedy payment pop-ups and shady pay walls. I would 10,000% pay full retail for a complete game, in game unlockable, and OPTIONAL Online and Online multiplayer. And if I so choose. pay for any 100% optional cosmetics along the way. 

Unironically. Its the reasons Starcraft and Starcraft II is one of my all time favorites. expansions and all. You could see and feel the passion put into those games, and experience all its content without predatory tactics. A full experience out of the box, Valued added content with each expansion, and None of it required you to be connected, But being connected just added more to its Value.

Even though the core gameplay is fun. Also the factions and units are cool its just too similar to the starcraft 2 or a warcraft 3 mod to recommend it for more than 10 to 20 dollars for the entire game.  Lately not a fan of over monetization of ever little thing that comes into the game. I remember a time when positive additions, features or cool new stuff without over monetization. I passed calc 3 in college. come on 10 dollars times a million copies is still 10 million dollars for small developers copy cat other games seems like this would be the normal. no they want you to pay 20 dollars for you to have a slice. 40 dollars for a little bigger slice. than 60 dollars for you to get 3 chapters of the game and 5 heroes.. 5 dollars for this 10 dollars for that. just overall feels not right.

steam,201537941,"Releasing incomplete games but charging for them as if they're fully complete has become the new normal.

But it's a free to play, right? That's the deceptive part. It's free to try, very much like Starcraft 2, but if you want to actually fully play the game, you need to get out that wallet, and when you do, expect to take a fucking dent out of it.

Sure, you could piece meal, that's what is encouraged. But the first campaign, then there'll be a second and a third campaign you can also buy down the road. Buy a single coop commander, but if you want to play any of the rest of them to max level you'll be paying for those individually too. But everything that is available right now, for the low low price of $65. That's right, you too, if you act RIGHT NOW, can lock in this AMAZING low price for basically an early access game! Fomo bullshit.

Did I mention the ""pay for everything"" option has already changed what you get since it's inception? Classic ""buy everything"" option being better the longer you wait. When will game studios realize that if you give players the option to ""buy everything"" it needs to include EVERYTHING as in all future content. People will pay a $100 easy for that, but instead they drip feed content and want to charge full game prices.

It's like they don't realize how many amazing $6, $15, $20, $35 games exist out there. Games that will give the player thousands of hours of play. And they're asking for $65 for the beginning of a game, next campaign will be another $25 no doubt, every new commander will be another $8. Do the math, that's going to add up to be some crazy numbers just to own ""the whole game"" down the road. That's the sick af, toxic monetization of these kind of ""free to play"" games.

- Frank Klepacki music
- improved, clean-looking UI
- smart 1v1 AI

cons:
- awful voice acting and dialogue
- lame pixar characters + story
- awful sound FX + sound mixing
- cutscenes that barely rival wc3 in quality (a 20 year old game)
- FG staff fake-reviewing their own game, deleting negative comments, ignoring negative feedback (negative feedback is still feedback)
- uninspired and wishy-washy race design. the vanguard are the chatGTP race and the demons are like a kintergarden-friendly version of Diablo units

mid:
- nothing ground-breaking about the 1v1 mode. the stormgate mechanic as it is currently implemented is boring, but has potential

agonizingly bland and disappointing end of a game that could have been great. where did the $40 million dollars go? a rock-climbing gym, sleep pods and massage chairs for their orange county studio?

If you love Blizzard style RTS like StarCraft and WarCraft you will feel at home real quick. Give it time to know the game and you will stay for longer.

steam,201530641,"EDIT: they fixed the bundle issue yippee!

First off, for anyone saying the only way to get the whole campaign is in the ultimate bundle. There's is a $20ish bundle in the in-game store which has the whole vanguard campaign. It's not on the steam page cus steam only allows 3 bundles apparently.

Okay, actual review time. I've been following this since the alpha. And let's be honest EA was a mess. The game has come a very long way since then. Is it perfect? not at all, but the amount of improvements and work that has been done should be recognised. The editor wasn't slated until 1.0 so that fact we even have one is crazy and the community has already built a bunch of exciting things it.

Game play wise, it's one of the more robust of the new RTS' out there. Path finding generally works as expected, auto hotheys are a GODSEND and it handles well. The time to kill is still long. It's not as long as it used to be, and stormgates add a nice explosive and interesting edge to the game.

It's not finished, co-op has had no love since EA since they wanted to focus on campaign and 1v1, but the core is there in a pretty solid state.",1754429470,2025-08-05 17:31:10
steam,201530474,"Not yet a proper release even if they claim it is. Campaign is ok but really short, feels rushed compared to Starcraft 2 or Warcraft 3, uninspired and has some bugs. It feels like a game made by IA and I found out it is. Up to you if this acceptable for the price. For me it is not since I paid 60 euros for this on Kickstarter. One good thing this game made and make me want to play more Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3.

I won't give it a rating or list a bunch of pros and cons because this product isn't fully complete, but I will recommend if you are a fan of RTS genre then consider trying the game for yourself and/or follow the development of the game when it receives a more complete set of features.  

If you're new to the RTS genre then I would also consider checking it out for the campaign, coop, and AI skirmish modes as they don't require any money to try.

steam,201524026,"I don’t usually write reviews, but Stormgate has brought so much fun and connection into our home that I had to share.

My husband is a longtime RTS fan, while I’ve always leaned more toward cozy co-op or story-driven games. I was honestly a little hesitant to try Stormgate at first—I thought it might be too intense or competitive for me. But wow, was I wrong.

We started playing the co-op  together, and I was immediately drawn in. The missions are super engaging, and the difficulty feels really well-balanced—even for someone like me who’s newer to the genre. There’s a real sense of teamwork, and it never feels like one of us is “carrying” the other. I love how we can talk through our strategies, support each other, and laugh (a lot) when things get chaotic.

The visuals are gorgeous, the factions are creative and distinct, and the developers clearly care about making this game accessible to all types of players. 

But honestly, the best part? It’s become something we truly look forward to at the end of a long day. Whether we’re pushing through a tough mission or just messing around and building silly base layouts, it’s time we get to spend together doing something we both genuinely enjoy.

If you’re a couple looking for a fun, smart, and surprisingly heartwarming game to play together—especially if one of you is new to RTS—Stormgate is absolutely worth it.",1754422715,2025-08-05 15:38:35
steam,201523481,"I’ve been craving a modern RTS that captures the magic of classics like StarCraft and Warcraft III, and Stormgate absolutely delivers — and then some.

Gameplay:
The core RTS mechanics are tight, fast-paced, and rewarding. Each faction feels unique with distinct strategies, and the learning curve is just right — easy to get into, but with deep mastery potential. Micro matters, but macro wins games, just how it should be.

Campaign:
The single-player campaign is way more fleshed out than I expected for a free-to-play title. Great storytelling, high production value, and fun mission variety. The co-op missions are a blast with friends too — super replayable.

Multiplayer:
This is where Stormgate really shines. Ranked matches are intense, and the matchmaking feels fair. The devs have made a clear effort to support competitive play without alienating casual players. Plus, no pay-to-win nonsense — just skill and strategy.

Graphics & Performance:
Looks fantastic without frying your GPU. The art style is sharp, animations are smooth, and performance has been rock solid for me. Also, major props for the clean UI.

Dev Support & Community:
Frost Giant is doing everything right. Transparent updates, active feedback loops, and a passionate community that genuinely wants this game to succeed.

If you loved the golden age of RTS or are just looking for something fresh and well-made in the genre — Stormgate is it. It’s the spiritual successor we were promised, and it’s only getting better.]

steam,201517744,"Would I recommend it? Yes, but with some caveats. It's campaign is functional, and massively improved from what it was. Is it as good as any of SC2's campaigns? No. Is it as good as WC3's campaigns? No, but the upgrades and research are kinda fun, and having a stash is nice. Team versus? No, that doesn't exist still. Co-op? It's okay, but I had hoped this would be more polished by now. 

I'm still not going to actually tell my friends specifically about stormgate at this point, since we're not versus players these days, and I want to be able to hop into games they'll enjoy with them. That means 3v3, 2v2, and co-op. Co op is better than it used to be a year ago, when they last played and got burned out quick, but it needs a lot of work still. The levels come too slow and most of the commanders don't feel fleshed out yet. 

Warz doesn't take off until later levels, he doesn't feel unique from Maloc at first. Maloc's feel doesn't match his aesthetic. There's no bonuses for burn damage and bonuses when burning enemies or burned ones are near or stuff like that (Warz has this with infest which is nice! But again it comes too late). Blockade is actually an EXCELLENT starter hero with great starter gear. Yet, he's going to really shine in a more defensive mission, and there isn't one really. Infested Hives is closer, but even at A4 difficulty the nights are pretty easy. Also Blockade doesn't feel very distinct from Amara. It's like Amara is trying to be the mech hero, and blockade the bio one (due to the gear and combat medics), but it doesn't really work and we still need a proper mech hero. Meanwhile Amara is kinda OP, which I love, I just wish the rest of the heroes reached that point as well. Rhykker is good! No notes there. I like Kastiel, but Auralanna still is just the worst. I levelled her AFK because I just couldn't stand her, and this was after they buffed her slightly. It's clear she's meant to be a support hero, and that would be cool if she was able to function at least passably on her own. But she's not. Kastiel is great though. No notes there. 

Okay, so, given that, why would I recommend this game? Well, because it's free. For a free game, it's not bad, and it's a lot better than it used to be. I think you could have fun in co-op with just Blockade, and the first six missions of the campaign are okay for a single playthough. I wouldn't recommend paying money for the rest of the campaign at this point, and you definitely shouldn't pay money for Auralanna (can you imagine?). But, you can have fun with the other commanders, I just would pick your favorite, and while Maloc is viable, I don't think he's on the same level as the other commanders. So, Warz if you like infernals, Kastiel if you like Celestiels, Amara if you like Blockade's playstyle but want more power, Rhykker if you like dogs and being OP. At this point I don't think there's enough co-op content to justify buying multiple commanders unless you're really enjoying it, and you appreciate the gear system.

As for versus? I dunno, people say it's okay. I played a bit and asked myself why I was doing this. I'm not 21 anymore, I'm not into it. It's not my thing. But if it's yours then I hear mostly pretty good things about it. 

Honestly, the game does have potential. I'm hoping somehow launch gets enough players that they can survive until they have co op and 3v3 working as intended.",1754416190,2025-08-05 13:49:50

It's basically a Starcraft II style story told in less than half of missions. It feels rushed, disconnected and inconsistent. It was fun to play but it ended with "".. wtf?"" feeling. 
Throughhout the campaing you are told some things, then they get retconed. There is an attempt at epicness but there is no buildup. There should be comradery but you don't have much opportunities to get to care about most of the characters.
Maybe, with more campaigns that would tell the whole story, the overall impression will be better. But just the Vanguard campaign is not satisfying in the end.

For any people reading this and you are thinking about dipping your toes into a RTS for the first time, I highly recommend you try out StarCraft II and all its content, its richer in almost every dimension compared to this game and I really hate to say it to be honest.

Worth trying out and playing it. A passion project worth supporting.

I've been following Stormgate closely since its inception and supported the project from the very beginning on Kickstarter. While I haven't played a lot yet and honestrly I am just a casual player, what drew me in (and still keeps me believe in this project) is the passion behind the idea: a group of developers going their own way in order to cut any corporate approval chains to create a new RTS experience, and openly sharing that their goal is to compete with the best in the genre—StarCraft, Warcraft, Age of Empires.

As someone working in IT and product development myself, I think the early access release did exactly what it was meant to: open the doors for brute, unfiltered community feedback. It's clear to me that Frost Giant certainly expected strong opinions and decided to go from them them considering the cost (hopefully in the short term). There’s no other reason you'd release such an early version of a game unless you truly wanted the community involved from the ground up. And in my view, I appreciate that transparency. It was a bold decision and there was nothing different to expect, a hard hit back. 

In the past the popular RTS titles were often polished over years before launch, but this is not the case anymore. The Industry has changed. Games are expected to deliver much earlier, while players still expect a full, finished product. Balancing that is no easy task.

I'm not a competitive player. I mostly enjoy campaigns (played both old and new version and of course I am happy with the updated one), co-op, and casual skirmishes with friends. And even in its current state, I'm enjoying the game and look forward to continuing with it. The innovation in faction design and UI/UX is particularly interesting. I find it natural to spot similarities from classic RTS titles, and that's expected in such a mature genre.

I'm especially eager to see what 3v3 team-based modes will bring, as they seem to promise a new gameplay experience within the RTS framework.

On monetization: let’s be realistic, this is part of the entertainment industry. Everything we enjoy comes at a cost. Whether it's renting a soccer field or going to the cinema, games are no different. That said, I trust that Frost Giant will listen to the community and design a fair monetization model. If monetization starts to feel greedy and more as a skimming strategy, it will definitely kill the game, as we already saw with other projects.

Stormgate still is on a rough path. The RTS audience is passionate but niche, and not easy to please. But I genuinely believe it succeeds. There are already a lot of accomplishments, a lot of proof that listen the community, and certainly there’s still a lot of promise, and it’s been exciting to watch it grow.
These are my current thoughts. I may update this review down the line.

Cheers.

And when making that comparison, I really see no reason to play this over e.g. Starcraft II, which it is heavily inspired by. The game fails to live up to most of the claims made by the developers, such as being ""next-generation"" or ""the first truly social"" RTS. In fact it is heavily derivative of Starcraft II and Warcraft III, with few noticeable innovations.

While the product speaks for itself, the developers' history of over-promising and under-delivering and other behaviour (including reviewing their own game here on Steam while posing as actual players) makes it hard to believe any promises they make for the game going forward.

Leaderboards have numerous people in the top 15 or 20 with absolutely ridiculous records -- 255-1, 150-0, etc. This may be a disconnect exploit, not sure, but my last three games have disconnected. I cannot tell who wins. 

Improvements: add the MMR to the win/loss screen after a game. Do not place people against the same player >2 times in a row. Allow players to choose - fast game, or close ranked opponent (in other words, allow me to wait for a close game so i don't get destroyed). 

Good stuff: It's fun. I was 0-9 and finally won one against cheese. Now I'll probably go another 15 without a win because nobody plays and it can't match accurately.",1754095895,2025-08-01 20:51:35
steam,201246196,"I want to like this game - I really do. Sadly, all the characters look like fortnite cosplays and don't feel like they're in the middle of a galactic struggle. Some cutscenes are nice, others are filler and bland. Audio balancing in the story is bad. As well as poor voice acting and stale backstories.

The core combat is 9/10 compared to other RTS - that said, this game will not be able to bring NEW players to the next generation of RTS due to the onboarding process. Biggest thing the genre needs is players and they don't aim to bring in new ones, rather just grabbing an already tiny fanbase of the genre. That's simply not viable long term and I feel that even Warcraft 3 will have a larger playerbase in 2 years. 

They would have been better off simply removing to story completely and do a short series of tutorials. It makes me sad that I already know this game won't last. Would have loved to have custom games like we did in our youth, but without the playerbase, it won't happen.",1754091225,2025-08-01 19:33:45
steam,201219956,"I've played the intro campaign and co'op and I am a longtime vet SC2 player so I will admit, I do have some bias to RTS games.

I love this game, I love the story, the units, the diversity, everything. The only thing I wish is that it had more content and better management when it comes to microtransactions.

Now I know a lot of reviews say bad things about the microtransactions and I will agree with a lot of them. It does show they need money, every RTS game does, but I am not intimidated or bothered by what they are asking. 60 bucks buys the game, period. The rest are either commanders or cosmetics and I spent well over $500 on SC2 between the cosmetics, campaigns, and commanders. I have over 10,000 hours in that game. So I'd say money well spent.

I will be spending the $60 on this game soon, and I will be recommending people buy the game at full price when it comes out. I hope it rivals SC2 and the devs keep working on it night and day because I seriously want this game to at least be on par with SC2. I'm not asking for anything fancy. I just want more out of SC2 and this game so far has delivered. I will be playing it more.

I have a Steam Deck and let me say, it runs great on it. Even though during heavy fights of 3v1 Co'op I do get only 20fps at times, I dont get any real latency issues and the game still runs smoothly even at 20fps. They do need to optimize it better for the Steam Deck though and let me further reduce the graphics but I cant really expect that much out of this system. When I get a laptop i'll be playing the hell out of this game. 

For the record, I get BETTER performance out of this game than I do out of SC2 and yes, I play both on the Steam Deck. I do use a mouse and keyboard. SC2 gives me really bad rubberbanding effects, lag spikes, and FPS hiccups. This game does none of that.

I really hope more people support the game when it becomes released, I think even in its current state it deserves support, the devs really did a good job with the co'op state.",1754063523,2025-08-01 11:52:03

Many of us supported this game because we wanted to see it succeed. A lot of us are hundreds of dollars deep into this game already. Why are there pre-day 1 microtransactions that we don't own? Was my $360 not enough? Now I need to be nickel and dimed with additional paid content on the first day of early access? Yes they gave me what was promised on Kickstarter. It still feels like a slap in the face that there is content in the game I don't own, literally before the game has even released.

The campaign is terrible. We're paying at least $5 per mission. It's almost like this is a meta commentary on people caring too much about the campaign so they purposely made it as horrible as they could. Maybe this is genius. The writing, the artstyle, this game isn't winning in any category. I have the graphics maxed out, the mouths don't move during cutscenes.

The co-op is half baked at best. I'm surprised at just how often Stormgate is falling flat on it's face when not only did these developers work on successful projects, they can just copy what they did before. You've done this already! You should know what to do!

It seems they've also forgotten one factor that made WarCraft 3 and StarCraft 2 so successful. The custom maps made by the community are wildly popular with a wide range of players. Are the map tools available? Of course not! This should have been a huge focus on getting out. Release the map tools to the community. Allow them to patch up the holes in this abysmal product. While you work out more trash campaign missions, the community could be keeping everything alive with custom games.

This is what I imagine a F2P version of WC3 would be like in 2003. Unfortunately for Frost Giant, it's no longer 2003. It's 2024 and this game is insulting. The graphics suck, the art style sucks, this game is behind on every metric I can think of. I paid so you don't have too. Avoid this product.

steam,199351527,"The Good:
Stormgate has good bones. It is markedly improving with every update, and gives off a nice nostalgia factor to those who played Starcraft and Warcraft. I find myself having fun with Versus and Co-op. I genuinely enjoy playing it.

The Meh: This game definitely needs more time to cook. It's pretty obvious that the Early Access is being used to get player feedback while FG is still building the game. Take EARLY ACCESS seriously. 

The Not-So-Good: Microtransactions this early in development was a definitive blunder. It definitely gave off the feeling that the devs were just out for cash. Players new to RTS may have some serious trouble getting into Stormgate. As a veteran of RTS (in hours played) but still a casual player, versus AI is a real challenge. On normal difficulty, enemy rushes come very quickly, and are quite dense. This can be brutal if you aren't on your game from the moment the match starts. Stormgate definitely comes across as a mix of Starcraft and Warcraft, but the split is about 90% Starcraft and 10% Warcraft.  The nostalgia factor can feel layered on pretty thick at times. I could absolutely see Stormgate having an identity crisis in the future if they don't continue breaking away from their Starcraft/Warcraft inspiration. The races for sure need further balancing as well, but I'm confident this will be fixed in the future.

Overall: It's an Early Access RTS taking heavy inspiration from industry legends. It's playable, and can be quite enjoyable for RTS veterans. Some to all of these issues could be ironed out in the future, so I'll update this as time goes on.

This is a solid MIXED review. I don't really want to put Positive or Negative here, but I'll make this Positive since I have hope for the game.",1752048078,2025-07-09 04:01:18

In the really big picture, the glaring issues since launch haven't been addressed.  The menus are bad, the opening things are broken.  The first screens that you look at and click on make no sense to be the focus of the game.  The introduction missions are annoying.  There's no place to boot up and feel like your not just thrown into the fire.  The easy ai attacks you at 3 minutes.  Most pvp are vs 1v1 tryhards on ping.  There's hotkeys that are super pain to setup and you can't setup multiple profiles if something works well in coop, but doesn't work well in 1v1.   The coop is broken in 0.5, the top bar abiltiies have stopped working and it frequently crashes.  There's really dumb passive race mechanics like infest or veterancy that really don't add anything.  The units either do almost nothing for one race like the kri and then a similar roles unit for another race can stun, splits in 2, has a wild attack, builds in supermassive waves and requires less micro like a brute.   How to do macro and build with the races is naive in simple.  The game is designed to be anticasual and most casual players will die within the first few minutes and never have an opportunity to get a stormgate.  The devs are largely tied into youtubers.  The campaign complaint was that it was short, so they removed the longest mission in the campaign and made it shorter in a rework?  It's like there's no testing done at all and no feedback regarding what is in it. 

Somehow they're just really missing the really big picture of what people view as a fun, accessible rts and almost everything they're addressing are not the really basic glaring issues.   Avoid the fans for this because they will just slam over and over anyone that says anything other than ESPORTS 1v1.

steam,198418390,"Having tried Stormgate out over its lifespan, I will first state I only spent my first money on it with its latest update (0.5.0) overhauling the graphics, campaign, and gameplay.

I was glad to see the graphics shift decisively towards a stylized gritty tone, which is more in line with what I was looking for from ex-SC2 and WW3 devs. The campaigns has the makings of a solid foundation, I am legitimately engaged now with the story that I look forward to seeing what happens next. Although I have mostly played Vanguard, the Infernals are appreciably much better looking as a proper threatening enemy (visually.) Very Doom/Diablo-inspired enemies with a distinctive and appealing visual style.

I was someone who was looking forward to Stormgate, was left a bit disappointed with the initial early release, but now feel comfortable financially supporting this title and putting time into it. Interestingly, I find I am able to match with opponents quickly in Versus whereas over in SC2 its getting increasingly longer. I know some folks prefer their Age of Empires or Command & Conquer, but I love the old Blizzard RTS, and this has the DNA of those games with some major gameplay improvements.

1.) Built-in building and upgrades hotkey menus. Compared to the older Blizzard titles, Frost Giant has included a number of hotkeys to help make building easier. You no longer have to select a worker or a building to build something. Hit the menu, click the button, and tell it where you want it to go (building or unit) and the game will auto split construction queues to different buildings and will pull the nearest worker for the build, and then they will go back to work. This is an extremely helpful improvement for slower APM players like myself.

2.) Game speed - or fight length I should say, is longer than that of Starcraft 2 and shorter than Warcraft 3. Earlier builds had battles last a long time, close to WC3, but now they made finds run closer to Starcraft 2 times. So units feel stronger, more responsive, but give you enough time to issue commands and make mistakes without it costing you everything.

3.) Development and Improvement - Let's be honest, Stormgate felt a lot rougher than SC2 because it was in early beta. To an extent it still does, but since I started playing Stormgate, SC2's development and updates have gone from occasional to rare to now essentially frozen. Numerous bugs plague the game (to mention one, arcade maps can't be uploaded due to nasty video injections.) However, in the same time Stormgate has vastly improved in response to community desires. Honestly, the fact they came back in a bit less than a year with this much improvement makes me confident Stormgate has a firm base to be built up on and it feels good to play even now. Look folks, old Blizzard is gone, and while those games are technically still supported, the team left in charge has to split their time between 15 different games Blizzard-Activision is ignoring. Stormgate is actively being developed and improving in the style of old Blizzard RTS. What more can I say? Frost Giant has the Blizzard-RTS style niche nailed down stronger than any other game on the market.",1751166192,2025-06-28 23:03:12

Fast forward to patch v0.5+, i decided to give it a try again:
What can I say? The graphics have improved, it doesn't look bland anymore. The game play feels fun, the units feel responsive, with that said, I actually think this game has a future now.

This game is by no means in a perfect state as it is still in early access. However, after the v0.5+ patch I am confident the game is headed in the right direction. I'm hooked at the moment.

Yes I know they arent called marines in this game, but they're effectively clones of marines and thats what i'll call them. you gave the terranesque faction a ranged infantry that moves faster when they trigger their ability.

steam,197352561,"I went into Stormgate hoping for a fresh take on the RTS genre — something to fill the void left by classics like StarCraft. Unfortunately, even with the understanding that this is an alpha build, the experience is rough. Really rough.

The core gameplay loop feels unrefined, with clunky mechanics, awkward pathfinding, and units that just don’t respond the way they should. The UI is clumsy, the visuals feel dated, and bugs are everywhere. Even for alpha, this feels more like a tech demo than a playable game.

To be fair, the potential is there. The factions look like they could offer interesting dynamics once balanced. The world-building has hints of personality. But none of that matters much right now because it's just not fun to play yet.

If the developers stick with it — polish the mechanics, clean up the UI, fix the AI, and add meaningful content — Stormgate could eventually be worth watching. But as of this alpha? It’s simply not good. It needs a lot of time, a lot of feedback, and a lot of work before it deserves your attention.",1750045386,2025-06-15 23:43:06

Absolutely winging it and you can feel it. The factions don't feel coherent, they feel like pieces they stole from other games/ideas and then stapled them together.
Here are just a FEW without going on-and-on-and-on-and-on...

::You guys like creeps? Sure! Creeps added, despite the creeping being incoherent and not well thought out. -- and there being no reason for them other than they forced it upon you. (no heroes or items) DO THE CREEPS OR LOSE!

::Wouldn't a flying Nexus be cool to see? Despite it being a huge annoyance and leading to degenerate game play where two Nexii play slap fight with their weakest unit helpers in the game and that's the round. 

::You guys like scouting? We give you a scout dog that gets into the action within 40 seconds of the game and now everything is annoying. (Aw, but AoE had a scout!! Come onnnnn!) No this one sucks.

::Was Jarjarbinks and the Gungan siege weapons lobbing slow bubbles cool to you? Well the tanks in this game shoot those missiles and they never hit anything! Don't you want to make them and play with them now? Aw, come on guys!

::Do you guys remember stimpacks for Marines in Starcraft? Well we did too, but we don't want to copy it, so we switched it up and they work the opposite of how you want them to and if you ever want to retreat with your Stormgate marines, it will be impossible and they'll all die. Wait, you're saying that's not fun or cool? (or even immersive??? why would a faction in-lore arm their troops with this?) If it ain't broke, snap that shit like batman's spine on bane's knee. We're innovating!

::Remember buster swords from FF7 and Zealots from Starcraft? Hehe, check out our blade dudes! Aren't they cool? Huh? Well, no, we don't know why this faction would arm themselves with these weapons when they have any other piece of superior technology (including chainsaws at the very least), but hey it looks cool right??? Aw come on guys!!

::Like strategic battles and taking decisive action? Watch for minutes as your armies take forever to fight each other getting clogged and stuck most of the time and the readability of armies being so low that your eyes blur and you just don't even feel like clicking on anything. Unable to gauge how it's going, you stay too long in a fight you lost two minutes ago, but at this point you don't care. There was nothing you were going to do/could meaningfully have done anyways.

::Remember the tired story line Blizzard used for Warcraft 3, Starcraft1, Starcraft2, WoW, and even found in Star Wars? We used it AGAIN here where the initial good hero wants to be strong for good so badly ... they become bad! WOAHHHHHH WOAHH WOAHHHHHH!",1749665559,2025-06-11 14:12:39

Then, when I finally got to play the game. If these tutorial missions are just a tutorial and reflect the difficulty of the ""real game"", a very small subset of player will be playing this game. Or maybe you intend for the game to be ridiculously difficult and not intended for new players to get into the genre? 

I played on Normal difficulty which was what was pre-chosen. I got through Mission 1 and Mission 2, But Mission 3 literally got me to rage quit and uninstall the game immediately, because trying to kite the last ""boss"" to not hit the tank was not fun when the boss randomly drops the leash while I didn't move at all.

I poked around the stormgate website looking for someway to link my account and discovered that the reason the campaign doesnt launch for me is not any kind of platform issue.

I may or may not  try the multiplayer, this has left a pretty bad taste in my mouth, a completely incorrect error message for so simple an issue as not having paid for the early access pack for the campaign? seriously most people arent going to be invested enough to come back and try to solve the issue and therefore will be completely lost as potential players and all because there isnt any kind of indication that the campaign requires purchase elsewhere or even where to purchase it.",1748043634,2025-05-23 19:40:34

I'm tired of the new business model and honestly just want to go back to the old days of purchasing expansions and getting only balance and QOL patches in between.

Stormgate will never be to me what Starcraft II was - my first competitive game and a formative experience. What it [b]can[/b] be is a correction in the industry back towards passionately crafted games with a purposeful and meaningful campaign. Can SG rebuild the playerbase that once filled the Starcraft ladders and now has moved on to other RTS or genres as well as bring the genre to a new generation? I think that a quality campaign and map editor has that promise, but it's hard to tell just yet. I am, however, excited by the new mechanics that SG has brought and look forward to watching as they grow the IP.

EDIT:
Campaign feedback May 19, 2025
+ Enjoying the auditory feedback when menuing
- Opening scene is improved from the original teaser but still seems lacking to me. Why isn't the antagonist more animated? The hard cut to the demon spawning seems out of place.
- Amara's dialogue voice lines are quite monotone. [This is ""Next Up"" on the current roadmap]
+ New art direction is a welcome change. SG has managed to blend smooth textures and realism in a way that is edging closer to the sci-fi aesthetic I had hoped for.
- Dialogue is a bit ""canny"". I would prefer if the storyline was a bit more of a drip feed with more organic dialogue.
- The loading bar during load screens and ""click to continue"" is a touch that is missing from SC2.
- Unit pathing algorithm seems a bit off - somewhere between SC1 and SC2.
- Movement voicelines can play over triggered voice lines in campaign
+ Unit design is awesome!
- I can take at face value that civilization is fully space-age. However, after 15 years, we really don't know anything about the enemy yet?

Overall you can tell the team is learning a lot as they go and building a good foundation. There are quite a few little things that can be done to bring the game up to a good level of polish now, which is a good place for them to be.",1747715831,2025-05-20 00:37:11

I definitely do not condemn the game Stormgate in any way and a huge amount of work has been done, but only and obviously in individuals. The whole game is very identical to Warcraft 3 reforge. And emotionally and visually, let alone mechanically, it absolutely cannot be compared to Starcraft 2. Despite that, I recommend the game, but I do not know if I want to play it myself, I am helpless. I have bought the first part so far and in some stages it seems amateurish to me and does not bring much in terms of feeling. That is absolutely exceptional and perfect in Starcraft. We will see how it all turns out. I wish the developers good luck.I will definitely be watching the game and the positives may turn into negatives.

steam,194771975,"I started playing after the 0.4 update. I've been playing mostly multiplayer. I'm liking it so far. The pacing is enjoyable, the art direction and overall visuals is good. The core mechanics are really solid. The soundtrack is good, even though I want there to be more tracks for each faction. The battles reward proper unit control, but aren't quite as fast paced or unforgiving as Starcraft II. This makes them less frustrating, but also means that the game is lacking some of the tension of Starcraft II. It also feels like each faction is missing a few units from their roster at the moment.

The best praise I can give is that I keep coming back to it, even when I lose. It feels rewarding to figure out what I did wrong and what I could do better next game, which is some of the most important things in an RTS.

Even in this early access stage, I've been having a lot of fun. Really hope it keep improving at this rate.",1747077304,2025-05-12 15:15:04
steam,194770046,"The game is kinda pretty, I also liked the cinematics. 
Not really comparable to Starcraft II, however I really wanted to try out and play the campaign...

!! BUT !!

You only have 3 level to play for free, then it wants 10€ to buy chapter 1.

Despite this the gameplay is clunky and janky. It's somehow too fast. I don't like the pacing. The units are often clumsy, they will just run towards death, no question asked. They don't obey even if you order them to hold position. There is no save option but an autosave happens every start of level basically.


If I need to pick up resources like Luminite shards, and my inventory is full, I first need to drop an item from the inventory to pick up the Luminite shards that take zero space in the inventory, only to pick up my dropped item back up again.

I don't like how the game controls, how units walk, the bot paths are often broken, and you'll end up with your units running in circles... So the gameplay is not very good. and the game is not very well optimized either. Loading times are atrocious.

In conclusion, the game should be better. After all it was made by some of the fired Blizzard staff that made also Starcraft II. And I'm sorry, but the pay to play model they use is pretty infuriating. 

As of now is still in early access, but so far I really can't recommend the game. However we will see in the future if the game gets any better.",1747075115,2025-05-12 14:38:35

- First 3 missions are free, then 10Euros for the next 3 campaign missions that are probably 15 minutes each, or 25Euros for all of them (the same three at the moment)??? As far as the first 3 missions go, the story isn't worth a fraction of that. And I highly doubt it will get better.

- Co-op is dead already, almost as if every single commander had to be bought.

Visuals: The game actually looks solid now, with better textures, lighting, and a darker refinement on the art style as a whole.
Sound: The sounds have become much more polished and balanced. The difference in sound between EA launch and now is night and day. 
Campaign: The overhauled campaign is infinitely better than before. The story and character models have all been majorly improved. The missions are much more engaging. Having a ship as a hub between missions where you can upgrade your army and talk with NPCs is great. Reminds me of the Wings of Liberty Campaign.
Versus: Pacing in versus games feels much better with units moving faster. Capture points still feel awkward in 1v1 though, I hope they try removing them for an extended amount of time to see how the game feels.

Overall the future of the game looks bright. Can't forget about fully customizable hotkeys that they added. Man the game feels so much better now that I don't have to use grid hotkeys.

I had to wait years until I could finally play it, and when I finally did, it blasted all of my expectations away, chaining me to it for years to come.

Now, Stormgate reminds me of these days. The bits of story, the concept, the idea behind it catches me and makes me want to play it. And now I can! Does it live up to my expectations? Yes. The basics are there, the mechanics and the campaign are good and make me want to play more, but I expected to be fully blown away, like WC III and SC II did. But let's be honest: WC III and SC II would not have lived up to, yet alone broken, the high expectations in their early stages of development, either. The difference here is that we can play Stormgate at an early stage, way before it's had that long nice extra polish, and that the developers do not have the resources that Blizzard had.

Before this update, I would have reluctantly agreed with the many people who complain that playing Stormgate does not capture the feeling of Warcraft III or Starcraft II and that the monetarization is problematic.

I do see the potential, but this is gonna be in the oven for a loooooong time. This game is in pre-alpha stage. At its core it's very much Starcraft, but they've taken a look at some of the other classic RTS games (AoE/AoM, C&C, WC3...) to see what are good ideas to steal, such as [strike]commander abilities[/strike] or a global quick-build menu, [strike]creep camps[/strike] etc. The celestial faction is very interesting too.

Controls just got a big update but still needs more. So far it looks to me like the vision for the full release will merely put this game a little ahead of Starcraft 2 in terms of controls and probably on par with it in terms of gameplay. Call it StarCraft 2.5. Red Alert 3 is still out there with innovative mouse gestures for formations and a ""select matching units across screen/map"" button which no other RTS game wants to borrow because they all think CTRL+clicking units is good enough (it's not, it's horrible). [strike]In Beyond All Reason I can just hold right-click to draw a formation for my units, which makes spreading units both crazy fast and precise! Age of Empires 4 has formation preset buttons a crazy amount of hotkeys and even the ability to modify the keypress recognition (tap, double-tap, hold). This game doesn't really have any such innovations (yet?).[/strike]
[i]EDIT: Line Move order from B.A.R. was added! Amazing, keep it up guys![/i]
Every time you eliminate friction in the controls you make the game easier for the player, but because he then has more free brain processing power for the game, it creates room for more complexity and mechanical depth, to put the emphasis on decision making. Stormgate is making baby steps towards that. We have yet to see how they're going to change the formula for gameplay, as they're currently using their time in Early Access for a lot of experimentation - the top bar for commander abilities just got removed and creep camps got replaced with ""stormgates"".

As for the cartoon mobile-game Pixar artstyle, I'm quite tired of seeing it in almost every new game, but at least it does offer visual clarity.

steam,193773254,"The 0.4.0 update is a great update that improves a lot of issues with the game. I love the redesign of the Infernal faction. They look so much better than they did before. I like the new direction with the infernal making them look more threatening. Seeing the new concept art of their redesign of the units and buildings I am looking forward to it.
The campaign is so much better. I didn't pay for any of the chapters, but playing the prologue got me hooked on playing it. The maps look really good, and I did find the missions more engaging than the original campaign. The new story of the vanguard surprised me because I didn't think they would recreate a new story. I thought they would improve the original, but no, they scrapped it. The new direction of the Vanguard makes sense now because they were a resistance group. Their designs of the faction do not fit with the whole resistance group because their armor does not look dirty and damaged. Instead, it is now a military faction that was gone for 15 years and returned to Earth to retake their home world from the Infernal.

They finally made the AI fun to play against. I like playing PVE in RTS. I was extremely disappointed with how terrible the AI was, now they are so much better in skirmish.

When I heard Blockade's speech in the trailer. It gave me massive Helldivers 2 vibes.

Even though this game had a bad start. I think it is great it went into early access. This update exists right now becuase of the community who cares for this game, and Frost Giant Studios are taking the feedback to heart and improving to make Stormgate a great RTS game. I am looking forward to their next big update.

I hope the next update adds color selection for the factions. I know you can change the colors in the gameplay settings, but it isn't like Starcraft 2, where you can pick the color for your team and the enemy team.",1745844157,2025-04-28 08:42:37

steam,193659666,"Stormgate Review:

Stormgate entered my radar with very little initial interest. I have always felt that Starcraft 2 is a near-perfect RTS. Why should anyone choose Stormgate over SC2? To me, that never made sense — although SC2 has its issues too. It wasn't until the interview between Tim and Lowko that I became curious enough to give Stormgate a try.

Campaign:
I liked the introduction cinematic, but stylistically it felt a bit like Fortnite in space. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but I wonder if it will attract the right audience — maybe it's just me.

I have mixed feelings about the campaign. I don’t like the sections where you are on a spaceship talking to NPCs; it feels more like an ARPG than an RTS. However, during missions, it does feel like a proper RTS again.
I also don't like the campaign mission selection — it feels off somehow, though I can't fully explain why.
I would appreciate achievements during mission selections, like in SC2.
I'm not a fan of heroes with abilities in every mission either, but that's a personal preference.

Mechanics:
The Quick Macro mechanic is genius. I'm still getting used to it, but it's a fantastic addition that makes gameplay smoother.
I do wish there was a proper in-game tutorial covering buildings, units, upgrades, mechanics — why you should use certain units, when to upgrade, and what each building does.
I understand the attempt to bring in elements from Warcraft 3, like neutral creep camps in ladder games, but it doesn’t fit this type of RTS. The idea of towers revealing your location also feels out of place.

AI:
The AI feels too simple and frustrating for learning. Right now, it scouts, then attacks with an army — and that's about it.
I actually lost to an ""easy"" AI while just trying to learn the game, which was frustrating. There should be an ultra-low difficulty setting where losing is nearly impossible.
Yes, you can play without an opponent, but not everyone knows that.
It would really help to have a variety of AIs with different build orders to practice against.

Match Flow and UI:
Whenever you lose or win, the transition is way too instant and at a very high volume, which feels intimidating.
There should be a smoother, more natural transition into the victory or defeat screen — even if it’s unexpected.
The score screen looks awful. SC2 has a near-perfect score screen — they should just copy that and improve it.
It would be fantastic to have a Rewind mechanic after a match ends — the ability to instantly rewind and review key moments without having to load into a separate replay file.
This would make learning from matches much easier and more natural.

The menu and options layout is confusing. By habit, I always press Options when I want to adjust hotkeys, but Hotkeys and Control Groups are located below Options as separate categories.
I would much prefer having Control Groups and Hotkeys merged inside the Options menu for a more intuitive experience.

Graphics and Audio:
I like the sound effects.
The music is a banger — really good.
The voice acting is strong and fits the atmosphere well.

Content and Replayability:
Right now, I don't feel a strong reason to continue playing.
I'll probably return at a later point, but at the moment, nothing in Stormgate grabs me enough to stay.

I enjoy SC2's co-op mode a lot, but I don't enjoy Stormgate's — and I can't really explain why.

Positives:
-Quick Macro mechanic is fantastic
-Good gameplay feel and performance
-Great music and strong voice acting

Negatives:
-AI feels shallow and frustrating for new players
-Abrupt and loud end-of-game transitions
-Poor score screen design
-Creep camps and reveal towers don't fit the RTS style
-Campaign mission hub feels awkward

Conclusion:
Stormgate shows promise in some areas, like its innovative Quick Macro mechanic and strong production quality in sound and voice work. However, many design choices currently feel like they don't belong in an RTS of this style.

While there are good ideas at its core, Stormgate hasn’t given me a reason to stick around — at least, not yet.
I'll be keeping an eye on its development, but for now, I'm heading back to Starcraft 2.",1745702810,2025-04-26 17:26:50

steam,193612776,"Do not play this game. It's not worth your time or your money. I desperately tried to like this game, I desperately wanted to believe that, freed from the hell that was Actvision/Blizzard, these hardened veterans of the industry would make something new, something better, something amazing.

They did not.

They remade the exact same game with a new coat of paint over it. The factions are different, the units are different, and the setting is different, but this game's Ladder PvP could be a mod in the SC2 arcade that replaces the factions and it would feel the exact same. This is a game where skill is not measured by critical thinking, forethought, planning and the ability to adapt on the fly, but in muscle memory, reaction time, build order memorization and the willingness to play 100 games in a row doing the exact same thing until you get .2 seconds faster at it.

The other gamemodes aren't much better: Coop is a laggy mess where 3 maxed out armies each led by a hero unit meander around the map completing dull and uninteresting objectives and constantly get in each other way, making it very frustrating and unwieldy. Commanders are 10 bucks each and the Gear system makes it so that to play optimally you have to unlock multiple commanders and grind them up so that you can unlock gear to use on other commanders... no thanks

Campaign was a complete mess before the rework, and after the rework is serviceable at best (speaking of the first 3 mission only because everything past that is paywalled) but that's not the point: FrostGiant has said that they plan to run a ongoing narrative for years, yet a mere 6 months after they launched the first 2 acts of the first campaign, they have already retconned the whole thing and remade it completely, while also changing the lore to support this new version of it. How could I expect, after that, that they'll actually not fuck up an ongoing narrative for years and years? There was no plan on where to lead the narrative to begin with, they're winging it every step of the way, after they made a big deal of reassuring players interested in narrative that the gamemode they like would be taken into consideration. That was a lie. Like always, we are getting the leftovers. and all the attention is going to ladder

I have little to say about the artstyle, it went from cartoony and derivative to just being derivative, so I guess it's half a step forward.

No amount of patching or balancing will fix this game, because its issues go deeper. It's issues are born of the hubris of the developers, convinced that they have nothing to learn from their previous projects: they made SC2, and it was perfect, so all they need to do is remake it and the end result will also be perfect. So if you like SC2, I guess jump right in and enjoy yourself, good for you. But if you were hoping for a similar game that would fix SC2's mistakes and iterate on the formula in a new and interesting way, steer clear. Go play Immortal:Gates of Pyre instead.

EDIT: The game has officially released, and is no longer in early access. That said, half of the features are still work in progress, the first campaign is a total mess, and despite claiming that 1v1 Ladder is feature complete, FrostGiant also said that one of the three factions is up for a full rework. I guess we just have different ideas about what ""feature complete"" means.",1745657412,2025-04-26 04:50:12

Having heard of the recent (0.4.0) update I checked it out again and... I can finally recommend it. Campaign is a huge step up in quality in comparison to what was there before and basically plays like AA version (don't expect tons of cutscenes but what is there is good tho) of WC3/SC2 campaigns with some of its own twists here and there thus far, it has more sensical and tonally consonant story now and game finally starts looking good. Of course it is still not finished but the progress made in past 8 months is very commendable, the willingness to redo so many rather foundational things at this point and with such a speed is also praiseworthy and very promising as well.

steam,193435287,"FOR 0.4
DISCLAIMER: If you are one of the people who think ""early access"" means ""90% finished"", this is not the game for you. Wait for 1.0.

TL;DR: If you want to participate in the iterative design process of a big RTS, come on along for the ride. If not, just remember the game exists for when it fully launches.

As a Kickstarter backer for Stormgate and extremely excited for the game, it was disappointing to see the original release tank the way it did. However, the devs gave ample warning that what they were releasing was FAR from finished. I was prepared to walk into an early playtest that needed a lot of work. More than that, I was excited to participate in the development of the game. To see so many people walk in expecting an experience with SC2 level graphics and balance and be disappointed was frustrating. It was like watching someone go into a McDonald's and be disappointed their burger wasn't Michelin star quality. Leveling criticism is an important part of the early access process, but the way people were practically gathering mobs to hate on the game bordered on review bombing.

Ranting aside, Frost Giant have made incredible progress. Since launch, they have pretty much ripped out and redone the entire campaign and overhauled the graphics. The main criticisms from launch have been addressed in spades, with more planned. The game still isn't balanced, but that is expected at this stage, and they have plans to tweak or entirely redo many of the units. Whenever Frost Giant team members appear in interviews or public press, they practically ooze passion for the game and the genre in a manner that is frankly infectious. They have clearly demonstrated an ability to incorporate feedback, iterate, and steadily improve the game, and it makes me really excited for what's to come.

Some quick words on monetization. They are going with a live service model, with the multiplayer ftp (obviously) and individual coop commanders and sections of the campaign paid. I'm not going to spend time discussing this payment model, because you've certainly already made up your mind whether this is a deal breaker or not. It's the system that SC2 eventually landed on and saw success with, and there are no plans to change this. Also know that they have put coop on the back burner to improve the campaign and multiplayer (the areas with the most criticisms) so coop updates will be sparse for a while.

In conclusion, the game is still far from finished, but massive progress has been made. If you want to participate in the moulding of a big upcoming RTS, then this is for you. If you want a polished experience, this isn't for you, and that's ok. Maybe wishlist the game and come back when 1.0 launches.",1745440879,2025-04-23 16:41:19

if you love rts i think i could recommend this game to you now. if you aren't a huge fan of rts, then i would wait a bit more. things are moving fast and getting fixed fast, and things are improving fast, if they keep this up maybe in another few months then i could recommend this game to anyone. it really REALLY is improving extremely fast. i'm VERY happy with how the game is progressing. the devs have been pretty responsive to feedback and have been diligently working on ironing things out and fixing things.",1745421648,2025-04-23 11:20:48

The game looks and feels great now, while still being obviously not entirely done.

The campaign they have set up so far has potential to be better than Warcraft III and StarCraft II Wings of Liberty campaigns. Hero progression through the various items and level up choices feels like a great iteration on WC3's campaigns, and the unit upgrades are reminiscent of Wings of Liberty but way spicier and hard to choose between.

steam,193376624,"This review is of 0.4.0.

So Stormgate has had a strange journey the past year, from a lot of former people that worked on Warcraft 3 / Starcraft 2 it was off to a [b] very [/b] rough start. So much so that I worried a little about kickstarting it. The art style was terrible, the gameplay was mediocre, even counting on future missing units and tier 3, everything in the game just felt too soon to show off to the public or it was heading in a wrong direction. This is coming from someone that played Starcraft 2 to death and wanted more content out of it much to Activision's refusal despite the game doing so well after going f2p and getting co-op.

As of 0.4.0 I can now see my worries are becoming more of a past tense. With such small updates the past year I was expecting more of the same, but with this patch they quite literally reworked most of the problems I had with the game. The art style, cinematics, voices, immersion, faction gameplay, and even story... It feels like it's all coming together now into a nice achievement despite the fact they're nowhere near done yet. They changed massive things that I don't think anyone expected in 1 update. It shows that Frost Giant has the guts to push forward and prove expectations wrong. Now in order to do this they had to make some cuts from what I understand. For example this update they completely froze work on co-op so a ton of things wouldn't become incompatible. In addition there's still been no word on their special 3v3 mode or map editor to make custom/arcade games like you would expect in Starcraft 2. With the limited resources they have at their disposal, and what they've done just focusing on the foundations of the game this update, I think it was a good move. They spread themselves out too far and had mediocre results to show for it, working on each foundation of their game and then expanding is definitely the right way forward.

I've gone from cautious to optimistic with this update and highly recommend everyone to at least try out the campaign and versus now as they're in a crazy different spot from before. It feels like they re-did a lot of things from the ground up in a good way in such a short amount of time with great results. I'm seeing myself looking forward to the future after this now that the dev team has found their way in how they want to go with this IP going forward. I'll be keeping my eye on it more frequently and just wanted to leave a positive review to show my support. Congratulations Frost Giant, this update was a success in making the game's foundations. THIS is how you should've started early access.",1745368434,2025-04-22 20:33:54
steam,193374506,"Used to play the early access build and paid a 60 bucks for this since last year. While the content then are very sparse at the very least the game worked fine. 

We gave them time to cook and they have been working to make the game better. Now that they added these new cool content and overhauled the 1st campaign it should be better right? 

It's an early access title and I get it but the game's Unreal Engine crashes (with different error codes) all the time with the new content to a point where I can only play a portion of the 2nd campaign and it's very frustrating. 

Tried to adjust and lowered the graphics down to medium, put the sharpness down to 0 and it didn't make a difference.

It's criminal for them to be able to charge 60 bucks for this. I took a risk at the time and unfortunately that risk is not worth that 60 bucks. I would suggest looks elsewhere and test out other RTS genre out there.

To be honest I would rather play the older build of the game. While there's barely anything in there at the very least it worked. This one doesn't work at all.

This needs more time in the oven and do proper testing in the game and it's absolutely not worth the 60 dollar asking price.

EDIT: It's truly disheartening. They had multimillion-dollar investments from various sources, including being crowdfunded by actual RTS fans, only to deliver a half-baked, uninspired, SC2 from Temu RTS game with ChatGPT patch notes and generated face animations, among many other problems. It's one of the biggest scams in the video game industry. Lying on the development of the game and on their values as a company are on a daily routine, too. I'm still wondering where all that money went.

The cherry on top is they want even more money to continue developing the game into their ""true vision"" for 1.0 which is absolutely ridiculous given their past.

In reality, this game deserves even worse reviews but many people here are RTS fans who are just too hopeful they can somehow turn it around because this has been one of the biggest, if not the biggest, RTS projects in decades which makes the whole situation incredibly sad.

steam,193372723,"The 0.4 update was good enough to spark hope for me.
I thought the game was dead after launch and would not improve much. The only exception for me are the celestials, their gameplay is entirely new and different to every other RTS and i like them a lot.

0.4 changed my mind and i have become optimistic now.
The devs have reworked a lot of pain points- especially how the game looks and the campaign.

The new story is compelling, the new intro and setup legitimately interesting.
The optional dialogue has good writing, especially with the robot and blockade.

Infernals, the demon faction, has had a LOT of redesigns and they are all way better then before. They look imposing and cool. Maloc especially- i like the design so much i want to level him up in the coop mode. 
Before 0.4 i did not even want to touch infernals because they looked boring and generic. 
The new designs are original and well made - i cannot wait until the buildings get a similar rework.
Celestials could also use new models, but their vfx already looks great.

Pain points:
Audio mixing, some of the sfx and dialogue in campaign is to loud- doors opening and amara when arguing with ryker especially.

The Ai-generated facial animation of the portraits is regrettable- it looks uncanny, rarely fits the dialogue (amara looks way to happy in the 1st mission, which is very grim) and above all: it could have been done by an actual artist instead.


To conclude:
The game has actually moved in a direction that feels good, there is great new art direction and the storytelling is good (if barebones but hey its early access). 
Ai animations look uncanny and their use is regrettable - hopefully placeholder and hopefully no more ai-content is going to be used. Better use real talent then automate it away. Should the game use more Ai-content, i would not recommend it; but for now that thumb can stay up as i hope it is placeholder.

August 7th 2025
It appears they have removed all the bundles, put out a Campain missions purchase and only the new Ultimate bundle. I applaud this!

Edit
August 5th 2025.
DONT BUY ANY OF THE BUNDLES ON THE STEAM STORE PAGE as it is, its all not worth it, except the $65 bundle. 
There is an in game store, you have to open the game where you can get the full campaign for $25 if you are only into the campaign and is the only place to get it at that price currently. the other bundles are actually more expensive.

Heros in game store are all 15% off for the time being but who knows how long that will last, their full price is still $10.

Original review:

If I am being honest the game needs some work still, and I can't justify $10 per hero in coop so I will wait for a sale. But the game is very fun, just some aspects are currently a bit pricey as they stand.

None the less if you can get some of it on sale, I could recommend this game they have bin putting in a lot of work, the went and redid the campaign and listened to feedback on art so they are taking steps in the right direction.",1745349224,2025-04-22 15:13:44
steam,193281140,"my computer is old and barely runs in the dx11 mode only at low graphics so i will not be able to play for real until i upgrade which was already planned. if you liked warcraft 3 or other RTS's of that era it is clear that you will love this game to me just off the first half a mission. first thing i did was click amara and she gave me funnyt comments after the first few which i always found amusing. after getting out of the village i went offf path and found an item and bonus story element so exploration is worth it. got to where you have a choice in the next mission so there will be replayability with different story paths or something of that nature, all elements that i will enjoy greatly when i can play for real. one issue i had was with some pathfinding where amara just kept running into a wall to get to an item i told her to pick up... im sure the devs will have that small sort of issue fixed by full release... not sure if clicking neutral creatures 100 times will blow them up i was a little laggy to consistently click the goats. only grabbed free demo for now but i will be buying the full game when my computer can handle it. oh also i feel default graphics should be set low and allow someone to turn it up cuz it took me 10 minutes to get the graphics to low with the lag from ultra (propbably a sign my computer is too shit for the game but still)

No, they haven't improved the game: the game lacks optimization and will send your GPU to heII of hotness - and that's only one of of its major defects. And I'm skipping all of the other problems, which are not few.

steam,191440177,"My reasons are very simple: The lack of content, poor UI, poor explanations, and poor controls.

I will be speaking as a player who came purely for the co-op as the world itself DID NOT call to me or interest me. For the lack of content expect to go in and buy the commanders if you want anyone BUT the basic one, remember that you actively DO NOT gain additional experience for commanders you don't buy after a point and a lot of their gear, which can be used on other commanders for co-op (providing powerful boons), has a level of PvE Power Creep that is...Hilarious to really say that. You also only get one human commander...That's it. That's what you own unless you pay $9 for a single commander. You can still play the others, to level 5 I think? But after that they don't even bank up experience of future playing them so there is little incentive to play them further unless you shell out $8.99 for a commander. The pool of missions is extremely shallow at the moment.

Poor UI and controls go hand-in-hand. Realize all your power meter and special abilities are on the top, your two types of resources and controls are all in the lower left, and that your mini map is in the lower right and isn't the most accurate. The camera is also pretty zoomed in, really needs some work there to be perfectly fair.

Last, and most certainly not least: Lack of explanation.

What I mean is there isn't an easy-to-find tutorial, no in-game codex I could find, that kind of deal. Something that should be in the game to help someone understand these three new races.

I have more issues with this game. Awkward units, what feels like a very weak identity for the races as a whole, and so much more...But I am hoping they can iron out most of these issues. But at this time? I can't recommend this game.",1743223801,2025-03-29 00:50:01

is the game the best right now? no its in early access.

is it over priced? no its free fucking game buy what you want, dont buy what you dont want its that fucking simple. 

is it fun? hell yes with 3 people or 2, one of the 2 people can just take the 3rd base and grow faster.

is there any thing i don't like? i don't like that some of the models look straight out of the website hero forged,  i have seen them actively changing models as the game develops, so i think it'll look great come final release.

- Some audio tweaks would be nice (especially for Celestials, also on roadmap)

steam,190142698,"I'd like to start with clarifying some things: first, FG is a small company and it is to be expected that they will take a long time before any real progress is made on the game; second, I think people don't realize what the term 'early access' really implies as a lot of AAA devs use it as a way to promote hype and generate more profit. In reality, early access is a way for the developer to get feedback from players as they are continuously working on making the game a reality, thus I think Stormgate has fallen victim to the market's idea of what early access should be like instead of what it actually is. The game is underbaked, and that is to be expected as FG has barely had any time to work on it - what happened to people waiting over a decade for good games like Starcraft 2? Looking back at early access videos of SC2, one could also see how unpolished and underdeveloped that game was, but after a decade of real development it turned out to be the staple of RTS. 

However, while SG does need more work done, which will probably take a few years (hopefully more than a few, as I would really love to see the game succeed), it has a solid foundation with its core gameplay and mechanics - as many have pointed out, it is a mix of Starcraft and Warcraft, with a bit of Command and Conquer sprinkled in there, owing to the portfolio of the dev team which has worked on all of those games. It is easier to get into than Starcraft 2 and is much more forgiving, but at the same time offers more dynamic and faster-paced gameplay than either WC3 or any of the CNC games. 

I am not even talking about the art direction and story, or whatever else you might want to point out (microtransactions) as I believe games should be defined by how fun they are to play and the CORE mechanics of the game show promise as after coming back with the release of 0.3.0, I found myself sinking a good 10 hours in just 2 days. The unit movement feels smooth, the time-to-kill of units and buildings is fair, and the resource distribution throughout the map (along with the bounties from camps) allows for a larger margin of error and a variety of build orders, making the game much more beginner-friendly.

The actual game itself, the heart of the RTS genre that is so beloved is definitely present in Stormgate and I firmly believe the modern video game market with its progressive and, sometimes, greedy practices desensitized its consumers which resulted in them not liking to see HOW games get developed or understanding that the process used to take more time, especially with smaller teams. The fact that FG is developing the game and allowing player feedback to change the course of this process shows just how much they really care for the game and reveals the passion their team has for the RTS genre.

I really hope FG can turn this around with future updates, and do believe they can do so as long as they keep their track record of listening to player feedback, to which you can also contribute via their Discord and Reddit pages.

steam,189588194,"I genuinely wanted to like this game because I loved the coop mode in Starcraft 2... unfortunately, this game, whilst having better controls in my opinion, just isn't fun.

I tried the campaign, or at least the free missions, and was bored. The music is just shockingly bad and doesn't fit an RTS at all. It's like some generic sci-fi crap hat's far too slow and soft. Unit sounds were also awful and far too quiet. The free missions were just dull, and I honestly don't feel compelled to buy the other missions (yeah, the campaign has to be bought mission by mission with real money) to find out what happens, because it's just not interesting.

So, I moved onto coop... man, what a disappointment. In Starcraft 2, different faction commanders could totally change that faction into something new and interesting. Offering unique units, limited rosters, unique mechanics, etc. Yeah, that's not a thing in Stormgate. The coop missions are pretty much identical, even having that defend your base at night and attack in the day (Dead of Night) mission, only less visually interesting. I'd be happy with that if the player factions were fun to play as, but they're not. Despite some minor differences between them, they all mostly play the same. They all have similar production structures, similar kinds of units, etc. Sure, Infernals spread a sort of infernal creep and Celestials have a slightly different way of harvesting resources, but they still build a barracks like structure, and then more advanced unit production structures. There's nothing remotely like a hatchery that evolves into a lair, etc, here. So all faction end up with these nondescript sprawling bases where the buildings are just vague shapes and look like nothing. It's boring to look at and hard to tell what's what at a glance.

The commanders themselves are just all hero units that have minimal impact on their faction. Don't expect a Tychus, Han & Horner, Mengsk, Zeratul, Zagara, or any other fun or unique commanders here. It's basically the regular faction with a hero. As they level up they replace one or two units with a slightly different version of the same unit... it's just not very interesting. Of course, with so few commanders you'll be teaming up with duplicates each game, which is also just crap.

Player count is also very, very low so you'll be waiting a long, long time for a coop match. Sure, you could do it solo by disabling matchmaking, but why? I want to play coop to play with other people cooperatively, not to play alone. When you do find a match you'll often be forced into a harder difficulty than you're comfortable with. So, if you're just starting and trying to get to grips with a faction\commander, you'll probably just feel like a burden. That's not fun.

When you do manage to get into a game be prepared to deal with a lot of AFKers. People doing absolutely nothing and expecting you to do all the work. if they're not AFK they've disconnected.

Maybe the game will change in the future, but I'm not so sure. I hope it will, though. 

It's free to play so you lose nothing downloading it and trying it out... just don't waste money on any of the microtransactions, it's not worth it.",1741351374,2025-03-07 07:42:54

For me, visuals are a huge part of the experience, and the current style just feels too generic. The ‘Demon, Angel, Human’ theme has so much potential, but it plays things too safe instead of fully embracing a bold, distinctive identity. It’s frustrating because they’re so close—a little more edge and personality could have made this truly unforgettable! RTS players, especially longtime fans of the genre, are more than ready for a war game with a striking, memorable art style. The game play is good.

Good art direction games(for me):
SC Franchise 
WH40k rts games
Dune RTS
Halo RTS

Make free skins
Take risk on the race's models art direction
Keep the guys made the gameplay this good and playable (rts are usually complicated the first hours)

Currently the game is well below the Starcraft 2 experience, but this last update brought it a lot closer to it. The ideas are good, the units feel unique and the gameplay is okay, but will be much better I feel.

[h3]But the main reason for the negative review is: The grind is real. [/h3]
I simply don't want to play with the game currently because I feel like I play a match and I progressed nothing. The good stuff for the heroes and units comes from levels, but to get those levels you need to play an astronomical amount of matches to have enough experience. 
Even more frustrating, that if you grind enough to get a nice slot 3 gear, which you can get by maxing out a hero, you will need to upgrade another one to lvl 20 to be able to use it on them.
So yeah, when SC2 introduced the Prestige system I nearly headbutted my monitor for the amount of grinding that introduced but this is way worse, and there are no prestiges here(yet).

I will definetly change my review to Positive if this changes, but as long as I simply don't want to play the game because of this system I won't be able to.",1741015852,2025-03-03 10:30:52

The extra quality of life features implemented in the hotkey system is really nice.

I'd love to see more heroes and more mission variety for coop, and look forward to checking out the campaign when 1.0 drops.

The only 'rough' experience I've had so far is the co-op lobbys seem a little buggy. I had turned off matchmaking, but it still chucked me in a game with my friend that was in my party and an unexpected rando.

Played SC2 for years at GM level, So i really only play 1v1 versus.

my god custom hotkeys is why i literally reprogrammed as much as i could with AHK. and eventually quit because of how awful the system was. even after getting used to it the lack of it really took away from the game.
So SOO glad this was put in and it has brought me back

Personally I have had fun with this game, I have seen all the controversy and shady crap (even paid the go fund me over a year ago) But i feel i have gotten my money's worth, since i personally enjoyed it.

The coop especially is a blast, and the pricing model is pretty much exactly the same as SC2 (F2P skirmish but then you purchase the campaign and any coop char after reaching level 5).

Would love to see:
1. More coop maps (the existing ones are excellent, so just more!)

Pathing is good, and plays like a SC/SC2/WC3 RTS game.

I don't really like the voice actor for Amara

If you're looking for a new competitive RTS, I think this game is in a very good spot for that. If you're looking for co-op, it's not quite there yet and the story could be fleshed a bit more. Overall much improved and I am going to continue to play.

Crazy paywalls are not what made Starcraft great. Comparing the two campaigns, it's clear which game does it better. A game from 14 years ago has better voice acting and story writing. I get that the campaign is ""still developing"", but this has to be a joke.
The cutscenes look like a ripoff of big hero 6. A ripoff of a movie that came out in 2014.
Co-op has you stuck playing as one species unless you pay 10 euros, which is genuinely Obscene.
The UI is weird.
Versus gameplay feels incredibly awkward, especially the early-game and the build orders.
The visuals are painful to look at. Why bare bones of all things?

The writing and voice acting is very poor which makes the characters uninteresting and the plot feel like a fetch quest. The maps and progression and pretty good, but they are underdeveloped. Controls are missing some pretty basic stuff like the CTRL and SHIFT clicks to grab and combine unit selections don't behave as expected for me and units tend to run off into the sunset chasing foes right into the enemy army.

On the bright side, I love the Q W E R shortcuts for building and training units, that is inspired. The engine is very solid and smooth and I don't have any crashing or technical problems. I'm glad that there is a satisfying single-player campaign even if I wish I could spend 4 or 5 hours creating some believable characters and buy Warcraft III for the level designers to check out.

First of all, the main character looks nice in the game’s images and is good in the gameplay, but in the videos and cutscenes, they’re extremely ugly—like the result of a human mating with a frog!! I’ll say it again, the images are very beautiful, but in the cutscenes, she is absolutely awful! And those two old men are really ridiculous, especially the one with the gun; their design could have been so much better. Regarding the feeling the story conveys to the player, I have to say the dialogue is very weak and disappointing, especially the soldiers’ lines. Also, in that prison stage, there’s a joke that I don’t think is very funny—it’s interesting, but in that apocalyptic atmosphere and situation, the soldiers screaming like a child and running away is just ridiculous. I’ve heard it multiple times, and I don’t find it funny; it doesn’t give me a good feeling about the story or the game’s atmosphere. Thanks for the game.

steam,188102285,"I currently do not recommend Stormgate, but I don't want Frost Giant Studios to give up on it. Even for early access, this game does not deliver what the fans and supporters were expecting. The game's success depends on people enjoying it and playing it together online. However, as soon as we were able to play, we were being prompted for microtransactions and there is a paywall just to play ""Chapter 1"" of a nonexistent campaign. There is nothing beyond that. The prologue feels like a demo to an rts game made 15-20 years ago. I get the impression Frost Giant wanted to see how invested fans would be at that point and to keep making profit incrementally on a game that is extremely far from finished. This feels greedy for such a small team that has already made millions, MILLIONSSSSSSS off of seed funding and series A funding. The Dev Diary states the team chose to be an independent studio so they could make the game they wanted to make. This isn't an excuse to release a half baked demo. I can't even go on to see how the game is progressing because no one jumps on to play anymore. Less than half a year later and they've lost all respect from the community that backed them.

Update 2.26.25: Still unable to join a game.

Update 4.20.25: Great to see Frost Giant continuing to work on the game. I have been able to join a game and the graphics are appearing noticeably better and less cartoony.

That's all I needed to see and experience to know that this dev has no clue what they're doing.

steam,187961341,"One immediate thing I would say from trying to play the campaign is that the draw distance seems too near to the characters and the environment. I am a huge (since 2012 HOTS) StarCraft II player. Whilst playing this I felt like I couldn't quite see my environment that well because I was too close. I would like the option to be able to zoom up and out a bit. Even with fog of war, It makes it easier to navigate in these games because side scrolling is needed much less, which as a baseline should also be a little slower. 

I think this game holds a massive potential but I think it's cartoonish art style lets it down. It seems like it's trying to be the fortnite of RTS when I imagine the player base to be a bit older simply because of RTS complexity. I know this is one massive criticism a lot of people wont like but I still think StarCraft II looks better than this. It was those good looks that got me into the game back in 2012 and made me grow to love it now. 

I love what the team building this are trying to do, especially with how Activision treated Blizzard before selling it to the highest bidder. Blizzard must have been one of the best companies in gaming to work at in the past as it truly represented the very best of gaming. They built games they themselves loved. So FrostGiant will always have my support for realising the gap in the RTS market and doing something about it. 

Another thing I noticed from watching team games is that the floor space to build seems very crowded. Like the game is impeded by the lack of space to build. 

In the campaign I also found pathing strange. As you find places you simply can't get to. I don't know if this is because of the draw distance or if it was supposed to be built like this but either way, it's dis-pleasurable for the player. I turned it off for now. (15-02-2025) but I will be back because I believe this might well become one of the best RTS games ever, in the future.

steam,187521492,"I have to recommend Stormgate as a good game :) I really like StarCraft 2, which lead me to play this one, and this one is good too :)

Now, admittingly, at first I wasn't too thrilled about how the game performed.  This is mostly because I have a computer which is becoming ancient.  I only have a Lenovo IdeaPad Y700 that I bought in 2016 =P.

But, alas, with some deep tweaking and tinkering, I found a way to make Stormgate quite playable :D

I've posted my solution here - https://steamcommunity.com/app/2012510/discussions/0/599643863737481964/
If you happen to be in my category where the game isn't playing well enough, then I highly recommend you take a look at my post in the discussions (link pasted above) :)

Now, as per why I think this is a good game - it has a lot going for it in terms of 'gameplay' :) Its well balanced, it has good economy, there's 3 different factions all with different strategies, there's some NPC characters you can fight too.  Its like SC2 in a sense, only with different stuff :)  Ironically, this may seem like 'Well, sure, its SC2, only with worse graphics and performance'.  But, at the same time, its a SC2 like game with the same gameplay, balance, and depth, which does make it good :)

Like a lot of people too, I might not of thought the game was that great at first, especially considering it didn't perform anything like SC2 on my laptop.  But then, after I thought about it, I asked myself this question:

""Would I like the game Stormgate if I had never played StarCraft 2 ever before?""

And surprisingly, the answer is a resounding yes :) Part of the stigma about Stormgate is it is very easy to compare it to SC2 since its so similar.  And, since SC2 is very very good, both in gameplay and also tech, its very easy to consider Stormgate as a 'bad' game.  But, when you think about it, if you consider Stormgate on its own and not compare it to SC2, its actually pretty good ;)

So, yes, I am a supporter of Stormgate :)  It 'is' good :D  Its probably not as good as SC2, but it is very good in its own right :)

Hope this helps :)

As for me however, the ""upvote"" is solely and simply for the simple, bare bones change of things or as others have aptly put, ""re-skinning of the starcraft"", and this is maybe because I have spent time in StarCraft 2, to the point that I can play coop with hideous mutators enabled blindfolded from the sounds alone. Unification Wars and Apocalypse Mod for Dawn for War gets pretty boring pretty fast once you hit the 200 hour mark learning all the subfactions.

Performance wise, since I am interested ONLY in the co-op and the non competitive versus, I don't need to dish out that 120 FPS as 60 serves my purpose just fine, which it maintains on a 9900K, RTX 2080, 32GB DDR4 and a SATAIII SSD @1440P on Ultra visual settings in Fullscreen Mode.

As for the Campaign and overall plot -- Its cringe, overtly linear and severely lacks any shape or form of gritty mature themes as opposed to Starcraft or Warcraft. Asking money for something that is still unfinished, remotely engaging and unpolished is the kind of scummy practice that the likes of EA have become notoriously known for. That path dear Devs, most certainly leads to damnation !

One thing I personally found welcoming is the variety of units that popular RTS lack, for it opens up opportunities for multiple forms of experimentation. To my knowledge, only Dawn of War mods have done this. Nevertheless, it is not without its fair share of frustration, as others have pointed out, too much information and formation on a time limit puts the brain at a melting point.",1738603837,2025-02-03 12:30:37

Game feels like a rip-off from previous blizzard rts with nothing new to add to the gameplay. If I wanted to play a better sci-fi world of warcraft, I would be playing starcraft.

The game is just boring. Boring game effects, battles, sound design and character design.

Serious lack of content as the campaign is blocked by a paywall and is just boring and lackluster that feels like it is half-ass'ed. Starcraft II could get away with this because the campaign's story had a lot of content with great replayability for a 15 dollars pricetag. It is insane to think there are people willing to pay 10 dollars for 3 whole missions. 

Let me tell you why this is so very much egregious. Imagine walking into a... let's say...  a car test site. Now you don't expect much of the car because... well... it is a unfinished car that the company that is trying to perfect it is asking YOU to test it. Now you get into the car and oh boy they expect you to pay 10 dollars for the steering wheel. Not just the steering wheel, the brakes need to be purchased by the same company. 

Frost Giant Studios should've let everything they release on early access free and provide decent enough content for their supporters before making this game feel like an EA slop. After that beg for money from their supporters.

The comparison isn't even unfair here either, because they openly advertised this game as being spearheaded by former Starcraft 2 devs. It looked promising and I played a lot of Starcraft 2, so I backed the Kickstarter for $60. But this game just is not doing it for me at all.

It's honestly hard to pinpoint exactly what it is, but it feels slow to play (in terms of pacing), it feels cumbersome to control, certain things aspects of the game feel convoluted for the sake of being convoluted under the guise of ""skill"", and overall it just feels really bland. It's just not fun. And with how much I supported the game and how much I loved Starcraft 2 until Blizzard did Blizzard things, I genuinely tried to give this game a chance. Yes, I know it's early access, but early access games typically show how the game will play at its core, and function as somewhat of a demo. Aside from knowing how the development process goes, I have played a bunch of early access games (as have many others) and enjoyed them, so this has nothing to do with this being an unfinished product. It's just... inherently not very enjoyable honestly.

Though I suppose this is not the first case of ""former devs of beloved game make a Kickstarted spiritual successor that fails to deliver in every way"", and unfortunately it won't be the last. But this is the first and last instance of me personally supporting one of those games. This isn't even considering the controversies following the devs (which also isn't an isolated instance when it comes to ""former devs etc"" games).

Lastly, I do want to clarify that I'm not just burnt out on the idea, that I'm not just in the mood for games like this anymore... because ZeroSpace offered a public demo recently, and I played that and instantly found enjoyment in it; I spent an hour in that game in a single session without issue. Meanwhile, my hour total here comes from me forcing myself to play over the course of numerous sessions.",1738341759,2025-01-31 11:42:39

The art style feels cheap and doesn't fit the theme at all. 
1v1 is functional but it's very basic, there's no real emphasis on map control aside from a few creep camps and endgame still revolves around 200/200 deathballing. Now, with a dwindling 100-something player population, it's almost impossible to find a decent match.
Coop is extremely barebones with only 1 map and overpriced microtransactions.
I didn't touch the campaign so I can't comment on that.
I feel communication from the developer has not been transparent nor respectful to the playerbase.
Overall this feels like a wasted opportunity, given the premise and setting - and the level of funding they had initially. This should have been the doom 2016 / doom eternal of RTS, instead with got a bad blizzard clone which looks like a mobile game.

steam,186386577,"Edit: Updated for 0.6.0

As an avid starcraft fan for well over 12 years, RTS games are something I'm intimately familiar with.

Stormgate 0.6.0 is a vast improvement over its earlier iterations. If this had been its EA release, I would have been extremely happy. Despite some teething problems - significantly LESS than before - Stormgate DOES have promise and potential. 

The gameplay loop is definitely enjoyable, whether you like Coop, campaign or 1v1. TLDR, game's a 7.5/10 for me now.

So lets go over a few things:

[h2]THE GOOD[/h2]

Most importantly, the game is free to play. While there is monetization, none of that monetization is actually relevant to the game's balance, so there's no pay-to-win.

The game controls quite well. Units are, for the most part, fairly responsive, and the macro is reasonably intuitive with a quick-build menu that works well. There's a lot of passion behind it, and you can see that in the way the game feels with the unit movement and control; a LOT of their early funds went into building SnowPlay from the ground up, and it shows - units flow and path extremely well, and there's very little delay in unit movement or action.

The game is built in UE5 as well, which, while not an engine made for this style of game (and specifically why SnowPlay was developed in the first place), means the game has - and will in the future, have even more - a lot of potential for user-made maps, game modes etc - which we've finally got access to!

It's graphically solid and consistent thematically, much better visually than it used to be. The visuals are, for the most part, pretty clear; unit fidelity is good - you can always tell what's what, though knowing which unit to target and kill takes some practice.

The Campaign (I played on brutal) has been reworked [B]COMPLETELY[/B] and the first full campaign is now complete It's no longer a derivative of Warcraft 3. While I'm not entirely certain I'd call the story [i]unique[/i], it's definitely a good time. 

The voice acting is much better, the character redesigns are a vast improvement across the board, there's a good amount of customization options through research and unlocks that improve your army the way you want, though notably you won't be able to get ALL the customization options, so you're forced to pick and choose, making each play-through reasonably unique given the various upgrades you can get - some of those aren't permanent, meaning they can be changed in between missions, while others apply a permanent upgrade to your units for the remainder of the campaign. These range from speed upgrades to health regeneration, to buffs, to increased resource mining, to upgrading to a completely different unit altogether, including units that aren't in 1v1.

There's a co-op mode that is actually fairly fun, if somewhat bare-bones at the moment. Much like Starcraft, it does have some fun mutators, and there's a gear system that you can use to change things up for your champion once you get past level 10.

The game is built around the 1v1 game mode from the ground up and it's quite fun, all things considered. With the 0.6.0 release, balance has significantly improved - though it has its moments where it can be a bit rough. If you can get past this, the game has plenty of promise, and each of the factions are fun to play. Celestials particularly are quite mechanically unique, certainly differing from any other race or RTS that I've seen, and while some inspiration is clearly taken from SC2's Protoss, it's definitely unique in its own right. 

The unit redesigns that were implemented are [b]GARGANTUAN[/b] improvements from what they used to be. The Infernal redesign in particular is a massive step up.

[h2]THE BAD[/h2]

The game's lost a lot of players, for a number of reasons relating to the rough beta days, so matches may take a while to find.

Being a pre 1.0 release, the game has bugs, though these are far fewer than they used to be in earlier iterations, and the game is significantly more stable than it used to be.

The game balance is... a Mixed bag, frankly, though this is hardly surprising given it is, again, 0.6.0.

Some unit abilities are counter-intuitive in the way they work, and can be frustrating to use at times.

The first introductory mission to the campaign has a couple pacing issues (again, I played on Brutal) - Amara's energy regeneration on this mission is very slow, which means the larger amount of units can very, very easily overwhelm if you don't wait for her regeneration. In saying that, it doesn't stop the mission from being fun, and the following missions pick up very quickly- the campaign is enjoyable to play. 

HOWEVER - If you want to play past the first 3 missions, then you're going to need to buy them - 25$ for the first campaign. The voice acting, while being much better, definitely has a couple issues here and there - some of Tripp's initial voice lines are definitely rough to listen to though, and Amara's voice lines occasionally miss the mark with their tone.

Co-op has a limited mission count/structure, and while entertaining, it can get tedious doing the same couple missions over and over again - though again, this [i]is[/i] effectively a beta game-mode. Something to note, the improvements from the Campaign haven't yet made their way into co-op, though this, according to the Devs, due to some back-end work that needs to happen on their end before they can do so effectively, so it will likely happen in the next updates. 

[h2]THE UGLY[/h2]

Being a 0.6.0 release, there's still the potential for many units to undergo further revision - particularly celestials - whether that be visually or for their gameplay/usage/abilities, so expect there to be a lot of changes and iteration going on. If you know anything about game design, you know just how much a game can change from conception to completion, and basically the entire game is subject to change - Frankly, that's a good thing!

There are in-game purchases. These range from story chapters to co-op champions (Which are PvE, so you're not dealing with pay to win) to cosmetics such as little pets or fog of war graphic changes (again, not P2W). And some of these are expensive; I'd argue that they're honestly more expensive than they should be in many cases - particularly for the co-op champions.

[h2]THE CONCLUSION[/h2]

The game has potential. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. And while I quite enjoyed the game - for the most part - there are definitely some things that have irked me about it. Ultimately it's up to you to decide whether you want to play the game. I do recommend it, though with the caveat that the game is still an 0.6.0 release at this point in time, and it should be treated as an Early Access. If you enjoy it enough and have things to say, take the time to check out the discord - [url=https://discord.gg/stormgate]Link Here[/url]

Ultimately, I've put roughly 75 hours into this game at various points, and the reality is that this is, by far, the best iteration of the game currently, and it's only going to get better. It's worth the time and effort that has been put into it. 

TLDR: While there are still things to work on, the game is a solid 7.5/10 for me, and worth playing, whether you like campaign, co-op or 1v1.",1737823725,2025-01-25 11:48:45

steam,186354082,"Stormgate has been billed as the next big thing in the RTS genre, but unfortunately, it feels more like a missed opportunity than a step forward. While there’s potential buried within, the game fails to deliver the polish, depth, and excitement that fans of real-time strategy are looking for.

The gameplay feels uninspired and lacks the complexity that makes RTS games so satisfying. Resource management is overly simplified, and unit variety is limited, leaving battles feeling repetitive and unstrategic. Instead of rewarding thoughtful tactics and creative playstyles, the game often devolves into predictable rush strategies that grow tiresome quickly.

The visuals, while modern, lack personality. The art style feels generic and lifeless, with none of the charm or distinctiveness that iconic RTS games like Starcraft or Warcraft brought to the table. Units and environments blend together in a way that makes it hard to stay visually engaged, and the animations lack the punch needed to make combat feel impactful.

The story, while ambitious in concept, falls flat in execution. The lore is forgettable, and the characters feel one-dimensional, failing to create the emotional connection or intrigue that could drive the single-player campaign. Even the mission design feels bland, with objectives that often feel like checklist tasks rather than exciting challenges.

Multiplayer suffers from balancing issues, with certain units or factions dominating matches. This imbalance, combined with long matchmaking times, makes the competitive aspect of the game frustrating rather than enjoyable. Add to that a lack of innovative features or game modes, and the multiplayer experience feels barebones.

While Stormgate has moments of promise, it’s hard to recommend in its current state. RTS fans deserve better, and until the game addresses its many shortcomings, it’s unlikely to capture the magic of the classics it’s trying to emulate.

steam,186264583,"I had high hopes for this game but immediately upon first launching of it alarm bells went ringing for me. I wasn't quite expecting an Early Access title that is in such an unfinished and early development stage to have so many microtransactions already. What is especially weird is how the microtransactions work in the game with PvP and PvE commanders being separate in thus meaning you have to buy them twice if you want to use them on both modes

It may seem harsh to judge an Early Access title or even review it as being so unfinished, buggy and in such a poor gameplay state but I only do this because they have monetised it already as if it is a finished game. So if you are going to start charging finished game prices well then guess what, gamers are going to judge your product as a finished product

Pretty much everything a developer should never do, these devs have done from releasing a product far too early into Early Access in a really rough state, to adding microtransactions to an unfinished Early Access title that has 0 guarantees it will ever be finished meaning any purchases are very risky as you have no guarantees you will get to use your purchase and as it is in-game microtransaction it is not eligible for refunds if they do shutdown

This could have been the next WarCraft 3 but instead we got a massive scam. Such a shame",1737685507,2025-01-23 21:25:07
steam,186251334,"As a fan of RTS games since the very beginning, having grown up with Command & Conquer, Warcraft, and Starcraft, I'm trying desperately to like this game and give it the benefit of the doubt. While the character portraits are still unanimated, and some voice lines and unit designs pull inspiration so heavily from warcraft/starcraft to be borderline clones, the overall look of the game looks polished and impressive. Unit pathing works the way it should; so far I have not seen unit's stuck on walls trying to cross the map. Ability and upgrade bloat is controlled; every unit has a few direct upgrades to improve its utility; however, visual appeal is where the positives end.

The main issues are content and the blatant predatory monetization apparent from the beginning. The ""campaign"" consists of janky levels that, outside of an extremely brief building tutorial, do absolutely nothing to introduce or explain, well, anything of how units, upgrades, or buildings function. You'll have to watch the tutorial videos, which take away all the fun, or play a custom match and experiment yourself. Past the initial prologue missions, further missions must be purchased, and according to the dev's own roadmap, campaign content is nowhere near a priority for them, with their focus being on the pvp ladder instead. Heroes for the flaunted co-op mode are all playable to initially try out; beyond that, you have to purchase or futher progression; add to that the fact that coop is extremely bare bones at the moment, with only a few maps, and nothing new or exciting in them. Cosmetic items are blocked, again, behind paywalls. After raising over $2 million in kickstarter backed funds, selling literally every aspect of every mode in your game piecemeal, especially with this little content, as opposed to just an initial purchase price, is just pure greed and a surefire way to upset your customers.

Do not expect this to be finished within the year as such games take up to 6 years to make. If you have time, patience, and enjoy RTS / SC, pour a cup of hot cocoa and chill while we wait to see what happens next... Personally I have SC2 or better level expectations from the team, but I am also inclined to check their year over year progress. I will revise this in December 2025, good luck!

I know these guys get a lot of bad press. But every company and general media puts up fake influence. They are just easier at covering it up. Like amazon buying metareview. Now its harder to tell if a product is bot reviewed or not. I'm 99% sure supervive and eternal return are bot reviewed, but they dont catch anything because of business censorship.

steam,185868601,"To anyone comparing this game to SC2 or WC3 

That is insulting to some of the best RTS games ever made. It doesn't even come close to half of what makes those games timeless. Stormgate shamelessly takes features from previous RTS entries and yet fails to even understand why such systems exist in those games. If I could make a comparison this would be like having a burger and ice cream and while those are delicious food items on their own combine them literally and you turn both into shit. Which is what Stormgate has done. 

This game promised to be a successor to SC2 without the same level of resources that went into making that game. It's so obvious with things such as the population cap of 300 from the 200 of SC. Every single unit having some kind of ability, the game just screams that it wants to try to be bigger than SC2. Yet Frost Giant Studios failed to account for the fact they don't have the same Blizzard level resources that was used to make SC2. They keep trying to add more features which drives up the cost, they had to go around and ""fix"" their art which obviously has to cost money. The financial mismanagement is so rampant it's a miracle this game hasn't already gone and imploded the same way as Concord. 

FGS has touted themselves as a company that listens to the community which is both ironic and a bad strategy at the same time. There has been reports that FGS fostered a toxic positivity environment and only took into consideration feedback they viewed as good showing they don't actually listen to their community. Conversely they rely so much on community feedback for basic stuff people should wonder if they even actually know what they are actually doing. Community feedback while it can be helpful is meaningless when the game has no clear direction. The devs make the game not the players. 

If you are looking to scratch your RTS itch Stormgate isn't it. This game is an over promised under delivered game with unrealistic standards that they themselves set up players to believe.

steam,185723355,"I've been excited about Stormgate since its announcement, and while I’m leaving a positive review to support the devs—who seem like genuinely kind and passionate people—there’s a lot of room for improvement to help this game reach its potential.

First, the good: the quick macro panel is a game-changer. Not needing to assign buildings to control groups is a massive quality-of-life improvement. Units feel fluid and responsive. Auto-control groups aren't where I'd like them to be yet, but I could see it becoming really cool if players are allowed to customize them down the road. Fully custom hotkeys are coming to the game, but the standard ones are very comfy and I probably wont change them.

That said, several issues hold the game back:

- The factions and universe feel bland and uninspired. The mix of sci-fi and fantasy is intriguing in theory, but the space angel/demon aesthetic feels corny and lacks depth.

- At higher levels, there’s very little skill expression. Units feel like they were designed in isolation, resulting in interactions that lack flow or utility. Defensive tools discourage multi-pronged aggression, leading to overly drawn-out games that end with death-ball clashes.

- The creep camps feel forced. A 1v1 match often spends 5–7 minutes on PvE, which detracts from early PvP interaction. Balancing the rewards from them has proven to be difficult and I believe it is slowing the healthy development of the economy.

- The economy ramps up too slowly (even accounting for its unfinished state)

- The time-to-kill (TTK) is inconsistent—some units melt instantly, while others seem unkillable. Expensive units like the Hellborn and Atlas feel weak in this context.

- Units are responsive but move slowly and suffer from poor pathfinding, which can be frustrating.


Overall, I want Stormgate to succeed, and I hope the devs can address these issues as the game develops. It’s a promising foundation, but it needs more polish, depth, and strategic complexity to thrive.",1737047367,2025-01-16 12:09:27

steam,185682553,"I really really wanted to like this game. It was so hyped for years as the spiritual successor to Star-Craft 2. Unfortunately, it failed to be that in every single way that I can think of. Everything from the animations, sound, or game play all the way to storytelling and map design pale in comparison to SC2. The worst part about all of that is that SC2 is a 15 year old. I'm just not really sure how this team of devs, who many of them worked on SC2, could make a worse game with technology this far superior to anything they had before.
On top of all of that they are charging for you to play the story right now. I think buying the game (which is how you can play the story) costs $40. The story missions (I think there are 5, but honestly they are so bland I barely remember them) are so bad and poorly done I don't see how their ethics can allow them to sell it to people. Even beyond that they are going to charge something like $10-15 for each story expansion, which will only have a few missions each. That seems crazy to me. Then there are all the cosmetics you can buy...$$. Why on earth would they prioritise in game cosmetic purchases when they haven't finished or even come close to finishing any other part of the game??
 
I really wanted to put more hours into this game but I just couldn't enjoy it all. Every time I played I constantly thought ""I'd much rather be playing SC2.""

This is in early access so I do hope it gets a lot better over time. Maybe it will be playable in a year or 2.  But that frustrates me too. Why hype up a successor to SC2 then release it way to early as garbage. I just seems so short sighted.

TL:DR
They should not have released it when they did, and charging money for what they offered is nuts.
They haven't improved anything over SC2 yet.",1736991164,2025-01-15 20:32:44

steam,185543363,"(Review initially set to Positive during Patch 0.4, switched to Negative on August 1, 2025)

Today should have been a landmark day for the RTS genre. Instead, it marks a profound betrayal of the community that funded this game's existence. As someone who supported the Kickstarter, I am not just disappointed; I feel completely deceived. This is not a ""1.0 Full Release""—it is a hollowed-out, unfinished product built on broken promises.

Let's be crystal clear about what was promised to us, the backers, who funded this project. We were told our support would help deliver a complete game at launch. That promise has been shattered.

The List of Broken Promises:

The ""full game"" we were sold during the Kickstarter campaign is missing its most critical, foundational pillars. At launch, there is:

NO Co-op Mode: The 2 to 3-player cooperative mode, a headline feature and a primary draw for a massive part of the player base, is completely absent.

NO Map Editor: The tool essential for community creativity and the long-term survival of any RTS is missing.

NO ""Team Mayhem"" Mode: Another promised game mode has vanished, further reducing the amount of available content.

These weren't vague stretch goals; they were presented as core components of the launch experience. We paid for them. They have not been delivered.

The Insult of AI-Generated Content:

What makes this failure to deliver even more galling is the presence of AI-generated content within the game. It is an absolute slap in the face to the community. The developers have chosen to take shortcuts with low-effort, generic AI assets while the bespoke, handcrafted game modes that we specifically paid for remain unbuilt. It reveals a disturbing priority shift—away from the quality and craftsmanship we were promised and towards cutting corners.

A Fundamentally Incomplete Product:

Beyond the specific breach of trust with backers, the game itself is simply not ready by any sane definition of ""1.0"":

Unfinished Factions: The lack of Tier 3 units guts strategic depth and makes every match feel like it's cut short.

Lack of Transparency: The move from clear numerical patches to abstract ""codenames"" is a transparent attempt to hide how far behind schedule the project is and prevent players from tracking the slow progress.

Conclusion: A Warning to All Players

This is not the game we were promised. This is not the game we backed. This is an empty shell being sold on the reputation of its veteran developers—a reputation they have now irrevocably tarnished.

To my fellow Kickstarter backers: We did not get what we paid for.

To any new player considering a purchase: Do not buy this game. Supporting this launch validates the deplorable practice of breaking crowdfunding promises, failing to deliver core features, and shipping an unfinished product at full price.

[h1][u]Unfinished, Unethical, and Unplayable[/u][/h1]
Stormgate promised to revolutionize the RTS genre as ""[b]the frist truly Social RTS.[/b]"" What we received instead is a disaster riddled with unethical practices, broken features, and empty promises.


[h2]1. Deceptive Practices[/h2]
The developers have repeatedly shown a lack of integrity. 
From faking reviews to inflate their score (a clear violation of Steam's ToS) to editing their Kickstarter campaign to remove backer benefits, their actions have been called out by reputable sources like [b]GAMESTAR[/b], the biggest German gaming magazine. 
They've even resorted to using fake accounts and parasocial appeals to manipulate public opinion. One instance even involved a developer pretending to be a new player but accidentally posting from their [b]main Reddit account[/b], exposing their deception.


[h2]2. Technical Failures[/h2]
The game runs poorly, even on modern machines, with inexplicable load times—taking about five minutes just to launch. Kernel-level anti-cheat software tied to China raises [b]serious [/b]privacy concerns. 
Multiplayer functionality is flawed, and the developers previously partnered with shady ""ping-decreasing"" services—[i]nothing more than data theft devices[/i]—which were promoted directly on their Steam page in violation of Steam's ToS. These were only removed after significant backlash.


[h2]3. Creative Bankruptcy[/h2]
Stormgate's gameplay, visuals, and sound design all feel extremely generic and uninspired. Units lack any unique identity, both visually and in their abilities, leaving them feeling interchangeable and lifeless.
The campaign itself is a blatant rip-off of Warcraft 3, offering none of the creativity or innovation that was promised. With such bland and absent design elements, the game fails to stand out in any meaningful way.


[h2]4. Shameless Monetization[/h2]
Despite being unfinished and barely functional, the developers are aggressively monetizing the game. They're selling six different Co-op Heroes at €10 each, along with a €10 Mission Pack or a €25 ""Deluxe"" Mission Pack, all with vague promises of future content that are questionable at best. 
On top of that, there’s €20 worth of cosmetics, even though the game itself looks unfinished, with placeholder visuals everywhere. 
Instead of focusing their artists on completing the game’s core content, they’re clearly prioritizing these cash grabs. Cosmetics and pets are things game developers typically produce when content is complete, not when the game is struggling to meet basic standards. 


[i](Total Microtransaction Price: 6x10€+25€+20€ = 105€, 85€ if we don't count Cosmetics)[/i]


[h2]5. Fear of Transparency[/h2]
For a game with ""early access"" status and a player base of less than 100 daily users, the developers' decision to restrict new content to invite-only tests is baffling. They claim to value public feedback but actively shield themselves from criticism, listening only to parasocial fans who heap praise on a deeply flawed product.

[h2][u]Final Thoughts[/u][/h2]
Stormgate is an unfinished, unethical, and unplayable mess that fails to deliver on its promises. Its aggressive monetization strategy, lack of transparency, and general disregard for quality and integrity make it impossible to recommend. If you value your time, money, and principles, avoid this game. This is a cautionary tale of what happens when greed and deception take precedence over creativity and quality.",1736690895,2025-01-12 09:08:15

steam,185384077,"Edit: I also became a bit bitter due to devs being overly ""omg this is toxic"". Got a warning for saying my IQ dropped due to a community post, lol. It's not THAT bad dear devs.

Do I think this RTS has potential? Yes.
Do I have a lot of hope that this RTS will eventually reach that potential? Not really. 

The whole devs reviewing their own game aside; I don't 100% know the details about that.. I think the devs just really don't know what to prioritize.

Like, why are the devs more oriented towards PvP and why are there patches solely focused on PvP changes at all in a game that is quite barebones?

The campaign is very mediocre; the writing is very cheesy, the voice acting is unemotional and the art style is that of a mobile game. (To be fair they are planning on making changes on the art style in some case)
Not only is the game lacking on these but overall the game feels like there is a severe lack of dopamine to be had. Animations don't feel like there is a ""wow"" factor, Co-op feels very unrewarding (playing a very high difficulty with a level 1 character gets barely a level) and the rewards feel ""eh"".

There is just no real excitement. The Co-op matchmaking automatically matches you on a lower/higher level than chosen (then again with the lower playerbase I do understand), but when you pretty much carry the co op it feels nowhere worth it. 

If you play online you're only playing against people who've been playing this for quite a while and just get destroyed. Doesn't help that you can get matched multiple times against the same guy in a row because once again, the playerbase is that small.

I assume the devs think they should prioritize PvP because their current playerbase is mainly PvP.. but when you have a playerbase of 80 people and a mediocre campaign/co op experience, of course you're going to get a mainly PvP playerbase..

If you pay for the ""ultimate"" access pack you get a severe lack of content along with 2 vanguard heroes, 1 infernal hero and 2 celestial heroes in co op. Now I absolutely hate how they decided two give you two celestials as they play the least like a standard RTS does and honestly I just really don't like their design. (visually and gameplay)
When you level up in Co-op, it doesnt properly synchronize after the game so you HAVE to play another in order to actually use a gear slot if unlocked though your last level up.

The discord feels very echochamber-ish. A neutral take on how to handle toxicity without the suggestion of it being an immediate ban gets you (un)favouritism on how the moderator there handles your argument that you're having with another person.

Upvoting your own feedback gets you ""You're manipulating apparent perception"" even though upvoting your own thing has been a standard in reddit and the devs even positively review their own game. (So it's very hypocritical) Plus it moreso felt as a ""I dont like your feedback hence why I am saying this"" rather than it actually being reasonable.

Also, some co-op maps are a straight up rip off from SC2 so yeah..

Unsure people’s gripe with this game. It is very clearly early days, and will be free ultimately.
What they have available is a good variety of different things to play, albeit do need more time to be complete, but again a free EA game, not sure what people are expecting.

The coop mode is good fun, especially with a couple of friends to progress and learn with. Different to the standard competitive modes. Looking forward to the 3v3 when that and vs AI is introduced.  

After sometime I think this will fill a void for several types of people looking for an RTS.

I've been following it on social media, and honestly for me, I don't think the game is in a state that I want to bother sinking hours into playing it. However, there have been people playing it and enjoying it, and I've watched the developers respond to the community in ways that are generally positive.

Have they made mistakes? Sure. I've seen some drama about backers not getting the full campaign, I can't really speak to that. Read those reviews and come to your own conclusion. That said, I HAVE seen the developers respond to feedback and they have put in the work. I feel like they genuinely do want to make the best game possible, and have listened to the community in basically overhauling the entire campaign, redesigning the visuals, adding custom keybinds and genuinely going out of the way to improve the game even if it means throwing away lots of hard work in order to do things right.

So yeah, I don't play Stormgate and I'm not super interested in playing it right now as it is, but I think the improvements they've made show they're willing and able to do what it takes to make a good product/game. I'm going to wait around until things are more final, but I think there is a good game in here and it'd be a shame if it never comes to fruition considering what a rough spot RTS seems to be in lately.

steam,185133396,"Updated: I recommend trying the game. after all, it is free. With the community custom games ( and game modes), you have infinite replayability. 

They relaunched the campaign and it is way better now. This is the state I would have hoped for on ""early access release"". Lots of good stuff, lots of stuff to improve on. 

With the changes they made to the factions, campaign and almost everything else I am more hopeful that they will improve on Co-Op and 3v3. 

Unfortunately, they seem to have a blindspot when it comes to business stuff. Again, they somehow managed that many people do not understand whats free and what costs how much. This ""what do I get for my money?"" stuff goes on since kickstarter and since then I keeps me from supporting this game financially. Still a fun game though. 

----------
Old Review:
- the campaign was so bad (story and technical wise) that I can not understand, how a professional experienced developer can greenlight it. And I even had access to the kickstarter-missions. 

- Co-op becomes boring quickly and is now a lower priority. 

- who knows when the 3v3 comes and what quality it will be in. 

- ""Social features"" none. actually nothing.

- The cash shop prices are very high for what you get.

The devs changed the text on their Kickstarter/homepage after the campaign ended, claiming that customers misunderstood.
-> ""All content year 0""
-> ""Funded until release""

I've been interested in this project for years but for me it's becoming more and more clear that there's a huge discrepancy between what the developers thought/said they do and their actual capabilities.",1736366461,2025-01-08 15:01:01

I won't comment on gameplay/maps because those can improve (for the most part it's fine, there were a few things I found annoying but they were pretty small) and I didn't play the campaign missions but after playing with each of the factions once, I really can't be bothered to touch this game again.

I didn’t sign up for a FTP model loaded with microtransactions. I supported this game as a customer, not as a recurring wallet. Locking campaign progression behind a paywall mid-development is incredibly disappointing and feels like a breach of trust.

Unless this model changes, I’ll be uninstalling the game and won’t be recommending it further. Stormgate had so much potential, but this monetization strategy is a deal-breaker.",1736131400,2025-01-05 21:43:20

Stormgate feels like WarCraft III minus the heroes and RPG mechanics, and that's not a good thing. Units have mostly confusing and ambiguous roles/counters, unlike StarCraft II (a similar esport focused RTS) where a unit's function and what they're strong/weak against is abundantly clear.

Competitively, the only consistent builds are all-ins and cheeses. Look at PartinG's Argent Rush as a very good example. He  uses Morph Cores to rush out two Power Banks and two Creation Chambers, overcharges the Creation Chambers then pumps out nothing but Argents on a one base economy.

Stormgate has such a small player base that players as low as Bronze are executing such builds with near perfection, meaning if you don't have the builds memorised, you're not going to climb at all.

To give credit to Frost Giant, they did some things semi-right, such as streamlining base building controls.

The StarCraft threequel we never got, and that no one actually wanted after all. Just generic online F2P garbage with the expected quality.

Say you go back in time, in the year of our esteemed lord GabeN's 2010 and this nifty RTS game that you've probably played all your youth suddenly gets a sequel released. It's called StarCraft II and while it didn't innovate all that much from a design perspective, its tight unit coordination, good AI, and relatively accessible gameplay made it a massive hit.

14 years later, a title tries doing something similar but more contemporary. Blizzard devs are involved too?! This cannot possibly go wrong! You're excited, your childhood memories are flooding back to you... Until you try to play it.

Let's face it, you're tired of all the online only garbage, of all the 'WaItInG fOr SeRvEr To ReSpOnD' that either fails or becomes quite shaky, and sometimes you just want to get a quick game in without having to troubleshoot it for 3 hours.

Yet what you're shovelled with here is exactly that, even if you paid for just about any campaign. There is no offline mode to speak of, even for the campaign. No internet? Well that's SoL. Servers down for maintenance? Go play something else. Game inevitably dies? (Possibly sooner than later in this case.) Too bad, no more campaign for you, no more Player vs AI despite you having paid for the product. 

The visuals I won't crap on, they're stylised, crisp, and offer plenty of visual clarity without littering the entire screen with complex model clutter. Not being able to distinguish these units is a definite skill issue, especially when it comes from StarCraft II players. This game will never beat the StarCraft II comparisons and another major complaint is the AI pathing, which feels more akin to StarCraft 1's with all the problems it manages to have with doing as much as getting somewhere. The amount of micromanagement necessary gets irritating pretty quickly I must say. They could have, at the very least, given us good AI pathing but even that didn't seem to work out.

For each time the developers are riding their ex-Blizzard dev high, they really failed to capture what made StarCraft 2 interesting or even fun to play. Among which was the possibility of playing it without an internet connection, had good AI pathfinding, and is generally a hell of a lot more fun to play. It's free too, and said free version includes the 'main' campaign of SCII.

So would I recommend buying the campaign? No. I don't even recommend you playing this at all when it's just a worse product full stop.

The story mode hasn't been developed at all; it's just a draft. So why is it already being sold? Then there’s the issue of the project lead's comments about regional feedback. Most of the criticism comes from Asia—does that mean the problem lies with Asia? Or is it an issue with your game's localization or cultural acceptance?
Standing in the developer's shoes and projecting your own perspective onto the game is somewhat subjective. The result is often based on your own assumptions rather than what the players actually want. Sometimes, it's as simple as just copying StarCraft2 to achieve success.",1735444889,2024-12-28 23:01:29
steam,184013391,"The story of TEA - 'Too Early Access'
This Game came out in a state, that could be described as 'Early access'. But through the last couple of years, games have spoiled us with 'Early Access' game, that were basically full games. Finished products, but lacking in content.
And let me tell you. This game was not finished.
Also, the visual style of the game didn't sit well with some people, but those are just opinions.
FGS fueled this perspective with promises of greatness. And I trully believe them to deliver... some day. But for now, we were invited to the dig site. Not a lot of people don't go to a lot of dig sites, wouldn't you believe? They didn't like what they see.
And all of them were right.

The game was full of bugs, and lacking in not only content, but in basic UX.
Since then FGS learned from their mistakes, and stoped promising people the nirvana of vidya... nirvidya... and starded actually delivering massive chunks of what needs to be there, before we are actually call 'EA'.

My opinion:
The game is really fun, its relatively low entry - or will be with a tutorial. The story might be fun, there is very little shown and did not pass any story checks - but they are working on it.
If you are not used to beta testing games or just don't like it - please come back in a year or two. This game will be the ♥♥♥♥ by then ;p",1735409417,2024-12-28 13:10:17

However: the gameplay is solid, units are fun and nice, the (start of the) story is good, the cut scenes are nicely done... It's really the sequel to Starcraft 2 we have all been waiting for.
And yes, there is a lot of work still to be done, but it is already fun to play and the mechanics are solid!

To bad it seem just right the game play for me not like star craft that every one loves but me the old ones yes but the newer ones became annoying at best for me in some of the in base leveling up style and the mission felt the same.

I really enjoy playing this game, and i am by no means a gamer, but i play some games for fun. I grew up playing star craft broodwar, star craft 2, age of empires 1-3, and warcraft. this game has the potential to be as great or even greater then those games with a modern twist. 

I am willing to patiently wait for this game and give it a shot, but i will continue to try it out and have fun!

give it a try knowing that it ins't done yet, they are willing to listen to the community that they are supplying this game too.

steam,182561853,"i honestly feel like this game has a lot of potential and i really think it will realize that potential as long as it gets funded and supported to the finish line. I enjoy the mechanics for the races, they all feel distinct from one another, and they also play quite differently than races from other major RTS games thanks to those unique mechanics. unit balance feels a lot closer to Warcraft 3 than Starcraft 2 (micromanage less units harder), albeit with higher maximum supply and no heroes. The dev team seems responsive to feedback and has fixed the game's most pressing issues in real time. I really think it just needs time and continued funding and support. It would be such a shame if the community moved on from Stormgate before these devs got a chance to show us what they were cooking. With that said, I do agree it's nowhere near ready for a competitive scene yet, and since PvP is really all there is to do, that makes supporting it pretty hard sometimes... but there's a lot of depth already in this game if you're willing to lab out build orders and work on controlling these units. Every couple of years there's another RTS that comes out that people call the SC2 Killer, but while i think Stormgate will never ""kill"" SC2, i think that unlike all these other titles, it really will be a strong and fun RTS in its own right once it's been properly polished. It is hell getting in to this game without a background in RTS though, not gonna lie. but i think if this game was in a different genre, with the amount of developer support and fresh ideas that it has, it would not be having such a hard time.",1734002194,2024-12-12 06:16:34

steam,182280115,"I really like the smooth gameplay and the team behind the game seems very nice, communicative and hard working. 

However I have some deep concerns.

1. I backed the 60 dollar tier on Kickstarter and while that was completely my choice and they could have taken the money and ran, they then launched early access with not just cosmetics but co-op heroes that I could not access even with my backing. This feels like a bit of a slap in the face and I do not look forward to seeing how monetization is handeled in the future. 

2. The artstyle and race theming is way to derivitive and not creative in my opinion. You have humans(terran), demons(diablo) and sci-fi angels(with protoss power fields). Now games are built off of past ideas but I think Stormgate has crossed the line into rip-off territory. When you advertised a old blizzard like rts I didn't realize you were actually just remaking their games, you need more originality. I am also concerned on the graphics and art direction, im not a fan of the more cartoony look for demons or the clean polished textureless armor of a humanity after an apocalypse. 

3. Campaign. I know this is super early access but the campaign has no interesting characters, no interesting universe, no interesting antagonist(wtf was that red metal dude in the trailer he looked so goofy, thats a demon? yikes), no interesting mechanics(same with the co-op mission) and it has so many bugs its not even worth trying in its current state(your heroes dying in a scripted fight mission 1). Just an embaressing show all around for the campaign and thats what i most wanted out of this. 

Its early access and I like the devs so this wont be negative review but you all have some serious work to do if this is ever to compete with SC2. You all released this way too early and whats on offer here has damaged peoples view of your game before it ever got the chance. I hope you can cook up a serious comeback.",1733685480,2024-12-08 14:18:00

steam,182205838,"RTS is my favourite game genre and after hearing that former Blizzard employees, that were making StarCraft and WarCraft games, are making a new RTS game, I was very excited for Stormgate. Unfortunately this excitement has faded away very quickly after I tried beta and now early access, and it was replaced by sadness.
Game world, lore and mechanics are like mix of what we got in StarCraft and WarCraft. The problem is that it doesn't add anything new. Also general quality of the game is like StarCraft II three years before release... (and this game was released almost 15 years ago) Graphics, animations, even sound effects looks highly unfinished, which means that if developers work hard for another 3-5 years, this game MIGHT be similar to StarCraft II... But do players really want copy of StarCraft II 20 years after it's release?
I'd love this to be a great game and maybe it'll take path like No Man's Sky and after bad first impression, it'll be a good game some day...

The Graphics issues have been fixed, matchmaking is better, and the visuals to everything have been wonderful. Celestials even became more in-line with normal playstyles and balanced, though still strange.
As a prior-Zerg player i am loving the infernals and trying out various things. 

HOWEVER.
Even though ive been following this project for about 2 years now, i do have the major complaint of their use of AI in the campaign most especially. Not only was movement somewhat awkward there, not only was some of the acting just bleh, the AI portions were atrocious. Smeared and streched talking portrait that looks like it came out of viggle, monotone and obviously artifical voice for a guy who had been talking like a normal human being literally moments ago. And the exposition, my fucking god. The writing and AI usage for the campaign made me want to get off immediately from how amazingly terrible it was. 
I would be willing to forgive some of the writing if not for the AI completely fucking ruining the mood in a way that's challenging to ignore, and id rather if an employee did a shitty impression instead because that'd both be more in line with older starcraft/warcraft, and it would be kind of funny atleast.

Taking the baby rant out of the picture, here's my reasons to give it an upvote: because the game has potential. 

What will change it to a negative review: if you can't stop trying to emulate Warcraft 3 and Starcraft 2. If we want to play those games, they exist already. Your game lacks its own identity and that's where the negative reviews are correct.

However, this game feels completely different, all the restrictions from SC gameplay is gone, you can manage your base anywhere with a bottom bar, and you can group as big armies as you want, there are no Hero units in multiplayer you creep with, instead you kill small creep camps with your forces to gain a small upperhand over the opponent. Game has decent balance but is still a work in process, all factions are playable and every unit has a use. No useless units syndrom at least right now. Also, it's free, give it a try.

steam,180827255,"NEW:

The developers seem to have taken player feedback seriously since early access. The graphics are actually reasonable, and as a campaign player I enjoyed the missions well enough. Still, they're not good enough to justify a 'recommended' especially with this pricing scheme, but please know that my prior negative reaction is somewhat mitigated. Still, this was good enough for me to bother with achievement hunting, so that's a plus! I really like the RTS quality of life changes.

Now, my core complaint about the campaign is that RPG elements are added to my RTS. I don't like RPG video games. There is too much going on on the in-between-missions home base levels.
- I don't like talking to characters every time I want to launch a mission
- Unit upgrades cannot be changed at a later time to try different combos
- The more flexible ""research"" is prohibitively expensive, using the same resource as you would for upgrading units. I went all-in on the research just because there was at least some flexibility, and therefore I didn't get to try what the unit upgrades add.


ORIGINAL:

I signed up for the Kickstarter not knowing what to expect from a game which desired to define the next generation of RTS. I must say I am disappointed in the monetisation scheme and that this game looks backwards more than forwards.

I am not a competitive player - I'm more interested in RTS campaigns and co-op. 3 campaign missions for ~10$ is bad value, especially for missions early in a campaign which tend to have less meat on their bones. I'll update this part of the review if I try the co-op mode. As for the 1v1 mode, it never captured my imagination and could not sustain my interest.

This game was highly ambitious in the role it would fill, but unfortunately it feels like it is rehashing factions, heroes, and storylines from various Blizzard games without adding anything new or interesting to the conversation. The unified controls feel good mechanically, but I don't see anything else that justifies this game taking up space. The art style is also unfortunately highly unappealing - overly cartoonish despite the game asking to be taken seriously - and is a prime example of the developers refusing to listen to feedback they were receiving from early on.

Although I wish I could be more positive about this game, I don't see it defining the future of the genre unless the developers listen to the feedback they receive more intentionally and selling at the very least a campaign that is complete on its own. The quality of the campaign story is dubious, but I don't think that breaks the game.",1732900298,2024-11-29 12:11:38

  Stormgate is more fluid in gaming, the progress in the map is faster and you dont have to bother with micromanagement of building and spreading your bases . The workers will do the job for you, you just assign where to build and one of them will build it. units produce faster  too. Buildings also. Stormgate is a modern RTS on fresh ideas that seem to work fine! I would love to see deeper stories and background stories but i hope they get more money so they can do that too . 

Plus is that the makers of stormgate are ex-Blizzard employees , which i follow to see their work (not just the stormgate ones, all of them) because i felt at some point that Blizz was not what it used to be , it got its soul sold to stockholders and when i saw good blizz people leaving i decided to check their work wherever they are as they possibly kept the ideals of old Blizzard.

Pros:
The pathfinding is fine. The fast selection for base building and unit production is nice. 
Cons: 
The writing is boring. I genuinely do not remember anything interesting happening other than the introduction of the celestials. 
The voice acting is *abysmal*. Almost every line reads like it's in isolation and stitched together. Exactly one character, Barricade, has acceptable voice acting; every other character ranges from bad to insulting that I paid money for it. 
Mission design leaves a lot to be desired. I sequence broke one of the missions accidentally and beat it without being aware that I was beating it, which is impressive.

Co-op is a little better now that its more clear which heroes you can use, and they've appropriately put coop and other parts in the LABS area.

this is where it should have been a year ago. it seems they've been pressured by investors to remove the early access tag, which isnt good but I can understand where they may be coming from.

The livestreams for tournaments have been fantastic, which shows that the multiplayer is still a decent focus. Unfortunately it also highlights that Celestials still need a rework and game balance is still a work in progress

I'd like to see them do well, but for free to play RTS game its good. The singleplayer content is okay, but not necessarily a great deal if you want to stick to only singleplayer content 




_______________________________________________________________________OLD REVIEW STARTS HERE FROM INITIAL EARLY ACCESS RELEASE
_______________________________________________________________________

Over-hyped and under-delivered. 

Creep camps don't impact the game much save for some resources or a siege unit. They've been working on the 3v3 that includes Heros, but without the creep camps that grant xp like in WC3, there really isnt any point in clearing them out in singleplayer unless you NEED the buff it gives (creep camps will regenerate and take back the control point, so you WILL HAVE TO RETAKE IT. Some people don't even realize that yet).

Co-op has been very lackluster in terms of variety and direction, as its all the SC2 missions and nothing actually new. In face, some are WORSE. They bring nothing new to the coop aspect, with promises that there will be heroes in 3v3. I am not holding out on it being remotely balanced on release, and I will have to wait and see if they can even get it out the door.

With the way things were promised from them this past year with the closed testing going on, the aggressive road map, and the constant bragging about how they used to work at blizzard, it seemed that the early access RELEASE (AUG 2024) was going to be a BETA, what we instead got was a VERY EARLY ALPHA.

stretched too thin and tried to provide quantity over quality with release, not to mention additional monetization after release (they already had 3 packs you could purchase for things like campaign and co-op. Both were a big focus (at least it seemed like they were pushing those into the early access build), and ought to be a focus considering there is a LOT of interest still in RTS co-op and campaign content in games. And both under-delivered significantly. 

The campaign had ""placeholder rough cut-scenes"", felt very short in terms of content, generic mission structure with no clear influence of the side missions (some side missions didn't seem to add a buff to the misison or inflluence the story. These may be reserved for some resource that is spent on base upgrades IF they even add that), the model for amarra was very rough (not sorry, it looked TERRIBLE), and to top it all off, it's the human campaign from WC3 reign of chaos, with some starcraft-lite mission structure. 
The co-op was...generic. Not any obvious innovations here, just super bland versions of already bland starcraft 2 missions. It is still a bit fun, but gets old REAL FAST. Heroes gaining levels with the xp from completing a mission feel unrewarding, with only a few rewards that seem actually useful (cryo tanks were not my favorite, and having to use that aurallana was no good for me.

This all would be fine and well if they had done one thing correctly from the beginning. MAKE REASONABLE GOALS AND ACTUALLY MAKE THEM. The game came out the oven into early access before the oven had finished preheating, and made worse by the fact there are NO DISCLAIMERS about things being rough or placeholder. In fact, any disclaimers/warnings came about after a pretty massive backlash. Almost as if they were convinced prior to launch that things were in a reasonable state.

The art style is also a hot debate. Like or hate it, they've made it CLEAR since the closed testing 
that they WILL NOT change anything about their art direction. They have caved in a bit and adjusted some of the textures and unit models to give them more obvious detail, but the main criticism with the artstyle is that it looks very bland (mobile game-esque) and lacks any gritty detail that starcraft had (and later from WC3 reforged, but we don't talk about that...thing). It also takes a while to even understand WHAT the UI is actually displaying to you, as it does work a bit differently with unit production, building, and upgrading. THOUGH I do LOVE this more modern UI, the only real criticisms I have is that the unit protraits should be animated, and the selected unit/building portion in the middle should be more clear, ESPECIALLY for units. For me, it shows very, very poor leadership if their OWN CONSUMERS are telling them that they don't like parts of the art direction. THEY SHOULD BE LISTENING, BECAUSE THEY're CONSUMERS WILL BE THE ONES BUYING THE ADDITIONAL CONTENT. It makes little sense to have conceded so little in such a long time.

All of this in total really made their audience loose both faith and TRUST in this group. To be honest, gamers (me included) can be very skeptical about early access titles and kickstarter promises, and to see it release in early access like it did and STILL be NOWHERE CLOSE to release now, its gonna be a VERY UPHILL BATTLE to regain people's trust.
Lots of mistakes from blizzard came with them, and its obvious they struggle to make good games without SIGNIFICANTLY more money. They need to be reducing some paychecks of their top management or SOMETHING, because only having 100 max players online makes it difficult for anyone to even join, much less get them interested enough to buy anything.

Frost giant needs to get their stuff together, and learn their lessons from the early access release

Strengths
Familiar Yet Fresh Gameplay: Successfully blends classic RTS mechanics with new features, appealing to both veterans and newcomers.
Diverse Factions: Each faction offers unique playstyles, enhancing strategic depth and replayability.
Engaging Multiplayer: Competitive and cooperative modes provide varied and enjoyable experiences.
Areas for Improvement

Campaign Depth: The current campaign is short and lacks narrative depth, with some factions not yet represented.
Visual Polish: Despite using a powerful engine, certain visual aspects could benefit from further refinement.
Learning Curve: Some factions, like the Celestial Armada, present a steep learning curve that may be challenging for new players.

Conclusion
Stormgate shows significant promise in revitalizing the RTS genre. Its combination of classic mechanics and modern innovations creates an engaging experience.

The game has improved a lot from its initial release and I've had fun playing around with it from the start.  I bought the Deluxe Edition very early on for $40 which contained ""Chapter 1"" of the campaign, which I felt implied that it would contain all of the Vanguard missions, (especially with this game coming from SC2 heritage).  I then got halfway through the 12-mission Vanguard campaign and discovered the last 6 missions were behind a paywall.  Apparently each set of 3 missions has now been defined as a ""chapter"" which seems to be a very convenient way to charge me another $18 to see how this story ends.  Do I feel ripped off?  Absolutely.
It is at least slightly ironic that earlier today before I discovered this paywall I had been thinking that I would absolutely pay more money to purchase the Infernals and Celestials campaign when they release.

Co-op only has two mission types currently, and if you play with the recommended Dx12, the lag is unplayable. But I wasn't able to actually play many coop games because there weren't enough players. The discord tells you to play solo, but they didn't include AI teammates so you have to play a mission designed for 3 players with 1. But because everything is so slow, from movespeed to build times, you can't even build an army to do anything before you lose the objective!

So I played a lot of 1v1. It works. The engineers made a responsive 1v1 RTS. But the units are very boring. The Vanguard are lukewarm design wise. The lancer is an incredibly incredibly boring unit and there wasn't enough there to get me interested enough to keep playing 1v1. 

The team are releasing balance patches, but the game is played by less than 200 people. There's absolutely no reason to balance things when the game is unfinished and unit designs are where they’re at. The thing that pissed me off the most was, I complained in Discord that the Lancer was boring as hell and I offered my idea for an interesting melee unit for vanguard. Someone said I described a melee unit you can only play in co-op. But I couldn't play co-op because there were no players and no ai allies. Which means that, the team prioritized having interesting/fun to play units in co-op. So they knew what would be fun to play and then decided to make 1v1 boring.

I understand the idea of trying to make 1v1 fun for all the players but this is definitely not the way. Its soo watered down I can't imagine this being fun for anyone long term.

They also have no solid plans to monetize the game, so the company will probably be bankrupt soon and the game will be taken offline. They've done a few things right, but they've also shown massive incompetence. They had a sizable budget but only developed an average game, they could have done 10x more with their investment if they hadn't been so wasteful.

It's free to play, so you may as well try it. However, there's a severe lack of content, so you'll lose interest quickly.

it's free go play it",1731347105,2024-11-11 12:45:05
steam,178814570,"So... I had SUCH HIGH HOPES for this game. I heard about it nigh two years ago, and was LUCKY to MISS the money-grab-drive they ran...
They have an interesting design, but all the devs who moved from Blizzard, are apparently NOT the same ones who made our jaws slam into the floor with Warcraft 3, World of Warcraft, and StarCraft 2 all those years ago... EIther they aged poorly into this new role, or management just didn't keep a tighter leash on the entire dev team. I don't know, and at this point in time... it doesn't really matter anymore.

This takes the graphics of Warcraft 3, mixes a bit of Warhammer 40,000, StarCraft, and and others, and scrunches it all up into an ugly little ball, and they're attempting to sell it to us... selling it to us on their Development pedigree and histories from the devs who worked at Blizzard Entertainment. And it's such a dissappointment to me that they would use and ABUSE our trust in them... to deliver us a game befitting of what they had once delivered to us. I dare not ask how badly they're being laughed at by their former-peers over at Blizzard over this farce...

Suffice it to say, the Graphics are pretty much a mix of WarCraft 3 and StarCraft 2, and they mixed in some Borderlands... But it all looks AGED nigh 25 years back to Warcraft 3... 
The Unit AIs are dumber than the digital rocks they're meant to move around. Especially PLAYER AI units...
The story is... *sigh*... it makes poorly written Harry Potter Yaoi-Ero Fan Fiction look better written.
The factions are skewed to favor the Angel faction, while the Human and Demon factions are incapable of being able to properly fight back AT ALL.
There's no proper Co-op Vs AI Melee, there's no Map Editor, there's no choosing the Co-op Commander missions, and there is simply PvP-melee, Co-op Commander, and Story Mode... The latter of which is so monetized, you only get 3 missions per ""DLC""?
Majority of the Co-op Commanders are pay-to-play(You can still test them, but only to level 5 each, and then they become unplayable entirely...), only ONE commander is entirely free, and he's not that interesting OR great.
I mostly just played the humans because well... that was the only free 3 missions to be played, and free-entirely Co-op Commander... so git gud I tried.
The servers are about as cheap seeming as cheap plastic Chinese as you can get. If you get disconnected while trying to connect, good luck! You have to relog, and then TRY TO MATCH MAKE AGAIN.

Sure... maybe one or two of these issues might have been worked out and fixed, but it's taken them THIS LONG TO FIX THEIR still-Early Access Game... 
But then... we're still missing all the Unit Interactions, and easter eggs we have come to expect from Blizzard Entertainment Developers... Do I HOPE they fix the game eventually? Yes. Do I HOPE they crash and burn?  ...  No.
I want to see them come back from this and come back bigger and badder than those devs said they were going to do. PROVE THEMSELVES to themselves and us, their fans.

The day this game goes full-release, I hope they go back on their ""Free to Play"", and they make us PAY TO OWN IT, like we did with Warcraft 3, StarCraft 2, and Heroes of The Storm. The day everything is as we expect it, and they're able to release this as a Activision-Blizzard-Microsoft Competitor, I will delete this and give them another fair review, with both praises and concerns as they deserve.",1731316749,2024-11-11 04:19:09

For what little I got to play of the game, and one must keep in mind this game is really, really early access, it frankly feels....barebones. It wants to be the next big RTS, but it took several steps backward. The best way I can put it, is this game feels dated when compared to other modern RTS games. I see what it was trying to go for and commend them for that, but when SC2 is clearly better both in play and UI, you should realize something is wrong. This doesn't even give me regular OG StarCraft vibes. It feels like an early version of WarCraft 3 and even then, feels behind what WC3 was in it's time. So in the 1.3-1.4 hours I managed to play, the game crashed on me 4 times. Be it because of my not meeting the minimum requirements, or, perhaps also, because them forcing the Easy AntiCheat with the game possibly causing it's own problems. Let this shit bake for longer, and DO NOT invest in any of the Early Access packages until you try the game by itself first. Good thing this game was free to play.",1731296436,2024-11-10 22:40:36

I originally backed this game on kickstarter and got to play early access.

At that point in time the game felt quity jankey and quirky to play and i lost some hope for it.

Then a couple of days ago i played this with a friend and have to say, i am very happy with how this game turned out. I mostly focussed on coop since that is the most fun for me and i can say that the weird feeling i had while playing in early access is gone and it feels very smooth.

steam,178707629,"I played it for only 4 hours, but I felt I saw everything I needed to know to decide that this game is not what anyone is looking for. 

Let me tell you why.

A bit to my background:
I spent the biggest part of my youth playing RTS games. I started with games like Dune 2000, sudden strike, C&C Tiberian Sun, Age of Empires, Warcraft 3 and eventually I discovered Starcraft Broodwar. The latter I played starting from around 2001 until Starcraft 2 was released in 2010, which I then played for 2-3 years until finally hitting grandmaster for a short period of time.
Eventually I quit, mostly because it made not much sense for me to go any further and because real life started to kick in (relationship, studies, job, you name it).
However, I never stopped playing games until today, be it to a way smaller degree of course. It is my one big passion. It helped forming a part of my identity.

What all good RTS games have in common:
- They all have a unique, compelling feel to them. Starting from the first click you do, from entering a menu, giving your units move orders, and so on and so forth.
- They take place in a credible world where you immediately feel home without thinking about it. And what you can do in these games fits perfectly into these worlds.
- They all have a unique selling point. Warcraft 3 had a timeless story with micromanagement focused gameplay. Suddenstrike was that WW2 game at a big scale which tries to be realistic. Starcraft is for the hardcore nerds. Dune 2000 defined the genre. And so on.

What Stormgate misses...:
.. is everything I just mentioned. It wants to pick something frome games like WC3 and SC2 (and I guess some more), but by doing that it neglects the chance to become something unique, something worthy of its own.
In the end it comes down to being a (way!!) worse Starcraft 2 in a world where Starcraft 2 already exists!
And this simply can't be a success.

They have no clue what makes a good game.",1731181072,2024-11-09 14:37:52

But does it succeed, or does it falter under the weight of its own expectations? Here's my take after a brief, albeit intense, play-through. I’ll revisit this after clocking in more hours, but here’s what I’ve gleaned so far.

Graphics and Visuals
Stormgate’s graphics are a delightful blend of familiar and fresh. The art style feels like a warm hug from Warcraft III, vibrant and detailed. Yet, some textures seem to have time-traveled from the early 2000s, adding a touch of unintended retro charm. Early access, they say. But if nostalgia were the goal, I’d dig out my old CRT monitor and go full vintage.

Game play and Mechanics
The game play is where Stormgate shines. The mechanics are refined, the unit controls responsive, and the base-building utterly satisfying. It ticks all the RTS boxes: resource management, tech trees, and micro-management chaos. However, the balance is a bit of a roller coaster. Some units might as well be brandishing foam swords, while others could topple empires with a sneeze. Early access, they remind us. Clearly, there’s a balance wizard needed in the mix.

Story and Campaign
The campaign is a nostalgic nod to StarCraft, with a gripping story line and well-crafted characters. The missions are varied, keeping the experience fresh. But every now and then, you hit a bug-ridden mission that makes you question your digital life choices. Early access, they chuckle. It’s all part of the charm, I suppose.

Multiplayer
The multiplayer realm shows promise. The ranking system fuels your competitive spirit, and the matches are intense. However, server issues and lag can make you feel like you’re commanding in slow motion. There’s nothing quite like waiting ten seconds for a unit to respond. Early access, they shrug. Maybe the servers need more than just caffeine.

Sound and Music
Credit where it’s due—the sound design and music are stellar. The orchestral score hits all the right notes, and the sound effects are on point. The voice acting, too, deserves applause. But then there’s always that one unit whose voice line makes you cringe. You know the one. Early access, they laugh. I guess voice acting lessons are on the horizon.

Overall Experience
So, where does that leave us? Stormgate is a game brimming with potential, crafted with love by developers who know their RTS craft. It’s a rough diamond, shining through its flaws with the promise of greatness. Yes, it’s got bugs, balance issues, and occasional server meltdowns, but that’s the beauty of early access.

For die-hard fans of Blizzard’s RTS legacy, Stormgate is a must-try. Just be prepared to weather the early access storm and hold onto the hope that this game will evolve into the RTS renaissance we’ve been yearning for.

I’ve reviewed this as best I can with the time I've played so far. I’ll be back for a more in-depth breakdown after clocking in more hours of game play. But from what I’ve seen, it’s looking good.",1730936879,2024-11-06 18:47:59

steam,178472137,"The early game access is not bad. the problem is you need to have a super pc to run it with good graphics.
I try to lower it down to stop the lagging and still had some issue.
The one negative aspect of the gameplay I found is characters voices are repeatitive.
the game it self is a mix of RTS war hammer, command & conquer, Starcraft with 2 main resource and 3 fraction plus hero with unique abilities.

steam,178460352,"Not inspiring/is-bland: the factions feel largely ""generic"", lacking real character. CTD on my first game, rapidly dwindling community so games are hard to find, especially balanced ones. Good luck finding a co-op match, I believe what remains of the community is mostly stuck in 1v1. Hard to read/identify much of anything due to graphic style and silhouette design, though maybe if one played enough they'd learn to muddle through it. TTK is fairly slow, but I consider that to be at worst neutral, but overall probably fine.
Perhaps worth a quick try if you really like the genre.
Note my experience thus far has been limited to a few PvAI matches on what I believe was the basic/regular difficulty, and even in my first match where I was largey blind to the specific gameplay and definitely to the faction (Celestials), I still won easily.

Hopefully in the future it'll be better (and I can change my thoughts), but I do not see much here to currently enjoy. Big meh, but good luck to FGS.",1730833703,2024-11-05 14:08:23

steam,178264947,"Where to start, I can't remember the last time I was this excited for a video game. I have been a big RTS player for many many years and even competed at high levels. I heard about this game and man was I pumped, told all my friends RTS's are back and this will bring something great back to the rts world. I was a early beta tester and did the 250$ kick starter to give as much support as I could. I really did enjoy the beta, lots of great things and obviously beta so you have to lower your expectations.

I loved the game up to the point of the release of the 3rd faction Celestial. I just can't understand why they'd go in this direction, it's honestly just trash and killed the whole experience for me.  The twitch and player base has completely died off and I'm sure a lot of other people feel the same way. If I wanted to play protoss or something like it, I would have just played SC2 as its overall just a better game. 

I was also very excited for the campaign, so I bought the deluxe edition package. Just absolute trash, all of it in every way. There was nothing good about it or fun or interesting about the main characters. I just feel like the devs have taking all this cash, mismanaged all of it and have done bare minimum to actually make a good enjoyable RTS game.


I feel sad for the RTS community, I highly highly highly can't recommend anyone to spend a dime on this game. You would be better off just playing SC2 or really anything else.

Obviously, there are a lot more things such as sounds, visuals, mechanics but I care less about that stuff. I'm very easy to please.

steam,178039484,"The story of TEA - 'Too Early Access'
This Game came out in a state, that could be described as 'Early access'. But through the last couple of years, games have spoiled us with 'Early Access' game, that were basically full games. Finished products, but lacking in content.
And let me tell you. This game was not finished.
Also, the visual style of the game didn't sit well with some people, but those are just opinions.
FGS fueled this perspective with promises of greatness. And I trully believe them to deliver... some day. But for now, we were invited to the dig site. Not a lot of people don't go to a lot of dig sites, wouldn't you believe? They didn't like what they see.
And all of them were right.

The game was full of bugs,  and lacking in not only content, but in basic UX.
Since then FGS learned from their mistakes, and stoped promising people the nirvana of vidya... nirvidya... and starded actually delivering massive chunks of what needs to be there, before we are actually call 'EA'.

My opinion:
The game is really fun, its relatively low entry - or will be with a tutorial. The story might be fun, there is very little shown and did not pass any story checks - but they are working on it.
If you are not used to beta testing games or just don't like it - please come back in a year or two. This game will be the shit by then ;p

I just felt like I should just say I support this project ever since it was announced. It was a dream come true, and I hope that it will eventually reach success despite this rocky start.

Please be respectful of my opinions even if you disagree since there is a bit too much negativity already. Nevertheless, I understand if people react poorly to me especially when they are frustrated, hurt, or disappointed.

Unfortunately my playing experience is a little bit rocky at the moment due to performance issues. 
With DX11 and with the recommended (which is probably DX12) it feels like the game is stuttering and not running fluently. Also my FPS ranges from 30 to 110 in the first minute of the game. 
It doesnt improve that much during the game.

I thought the game costed money until today and I was super excited to buy it eventually - then my friend pointed out it was free and I was worried but hopeful...then I played it and now I don't want to buy it anymore.

I want to reiterate, I *REALLY* want this game to be good but monetization is bonkers bad and the whole game is too easy.  I'm not some pro RTS player, I lost half of my AI skirmishes on hard on SC2 lol I'm just a slightly above average filthy casual and this game has me feeling like xXRTS_God6969Xx with how easily I steamrolled it.

Devs, if you're reading reviews PLEASE consider just charging people for the game and not for everything within it.

Nope, fuck em.  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.  I'm not buying the game i bought, to play the game i bought.  We got scammed, time to accept it, learn from it, and move on.


Second (chance) review:

Given the unexpected reach this review had, I figured I had somewhat of a responsibility to return to this and be fair to the devs.  I don't want to just drag them down, beat a dead horse, and watch them fail.  I became aware of new information after posting my original (angry) review.

On day one of release after the kickstarter campaign, they released the Co-op commander Warz, for $10.  They acknowledged that fuck up here: 

https://playstormgate.com/news/early-access-preview-learnings-and-feedback

Giving out the next Co-op commander (Kastiel) to people who backed the game was the attempt to make it right.  That can be found here:

https://playstormgate.com/news/content-update-0-1-0

With that out of the way, this game is effectively in Alpha, not Beta.  It is incomplete, and was heavily overhyped and underdeliverd.  From the bit I've played since the official Beta, the game has improved SIGNIFICANTLY, but still needs a bit more work before i return to it.

I don't regret my small part in helping fund this game, as it does have potential, but i did feel a bit stabbed in the back from the initial co-op fiasco.


Original Review That I Left:

The beta was a cluster fuck, so i decided to give it a little while before installing and booting up the game.  The first time i do, i find that there is a Co-op commander (the only game mode i care about) which i don't own being sold for $10, after i spent $60 backing the game, plus a bonus $20 on the kickstarter simply because i wanted this game to exist.

steam,177182268,"It's got the bones of a good RTS, but it needs more time in the oven. Gameplay is super simplified to the point where you even have an A.I. ""buddy"" by default to handle simple tasks. Kinda gives the game a mobile game feel. This is very clearly heavily inspired by Blizzard IPs the devs used to work on—specifically [i]StarCraft[/i] and a little bit of [i]Diablo[/i]. This is essentially a simplified [i]StarCraft[/i], replacing the Zerg with space demons and the Protoss with space angels. 

The whole ""angels vs. demons in space"" thing is one of the aspects that really puts me off of the game. It's more supernatural or religious than science fiction. It feels like a shortcut rather than designing new races, especially when one of the main space angels looks straight up like Tyrael from [i]Diablo[/i].

The biggest disappointment for me was how incredibly short, easy, and expensive the campaign is. There's currently only one campaign(humans) with the others on the way, and each of the six chapters only take 10-15 minutes to complete. But there's almost no lore to speak of—especially for the space angels—which makes the campaign really bland and stale.

I'm going to revisit it in like 6 months or so to see if it's improved.",1729122216,2024-10-16 19:43:36

Co-op was a great introduction to RTS for my kids (I played with them), requiring team work as events require your team to be in multiple places at once and coordinate. 

The game isn't done yet, and definitely doesn't feel complete, but as a free game this one is a good time, and has lots of future promise as they continue the story and improve the visuals. Is it as good as Starcraft 2? Not yet, but it's still an interesting game.",1728945239,2024-10-14 18:33:59

It could be argued that Stormgate is *all* Real-Time Strategy games, because it borrows so heavily from the rest of the genre.

This is the source of the division.

----------------------
There are, of course, the usual anti-woke brigadiers complaining about how the females don't wear space chainmail bikinis or whatever. I have now acknowledged the fact that these views exist, and I invite you to join me in giving them all the attention they deserve: No more at all.
----------------------

I could go on about how long I've played RTS video games. All you need to know is I was playing RTS games since before they birthed MOBAs.

And Stormgate feels like peak of the form.

Don't me wrong: It's not the best overall RTS (because that's not how RTSs work). It's not the one with the quickest CPS (Clicks-Per-Second, which is how the pros measure their playspeed). It's not the one with the best mods (YET).

But it is definitely, without any shadow of a doubt, a game ANY gamer can get into.

ANY gamer who's interested, naturally.

If I had a friend who didn't play RTSs and was interested, this is the game I'd use. The onboarding (the process of teaching you about the game) is streamlined.

There are two ways to learn the game, and I've never seen one of them before. The most obvious way is to use the first few missions of the campaign, which is implemented perfectly here. By the time you finish the prologue, you'll understand the UI, how to move and attack with your units, and which tier 1 buildings to build - and more importantly, *why* to build them.

Some players may find that a little bit 'handholdy'. These same players are probably experienced enough to know that's business as usual for the first few missions.

I have completed the prologue and am ready to begin the campaign. I FEEL ready to begin the campaign.

I know in my mind that I have already begun the campaign. The prologue is obviously the beginning of the campaign. But in my heart, I know it's just been the tutorial.

So I did what any other insane person would do in my position: I tried out Skirmish Mode instead of continuing the campaign.

-------------------------------------------

Beyond the campaign, there are also a few other game modes, all of which can be done in solo (with and/or against bots) or multiplayer.

Co-op mode in particular interests me. Co-op in RTS isn't the same as 'team multiplayer'. Instead of just getting a base map and one enemy or more, you get a random (but fully fleshed out) scenario. The most common one is the 'Stop the convoys' which is exactly what it sounds like.

I loved the co-op mode in Starcraft 2 but I hated being forced to play with other humans. Stormgate allows me to play it solo.

Stormgate Co-op is tougher than SC2 Co-op because Stormgate is designed for 3 players (compared to SC2's two-player Co-op) - and yet we're allowed to try it all on our own if we want.

THAT.

That right there.

That's why I like Stormgate - because the handholding only happens during the teaching part. You can solo ANYTHING in the entire game, or die trying. If I want to play against 4 AI enemies, I can just rack it up. I don't have to trick the game into that, like with SC2. And I get to use my skins if there's more than 4 players - unlike Starcraft 2 with its arbitrary anti-fun limits.

-----------------------------------------

Skirmish mode can be played at Tutorial Difficulty - basically the same as Beginner, but you get onscreen tips/prompts to help you get a basic base set up.

I have never seen that in any other game ever. They usually EITHER do campaign stuff, or have a bunch of annoying popups that players end up ignoring during Skirmish matches.

Don't like lengthy tutorials OR campaigns? WELL GET STUFFED say most games. But not Stormgate.

Good guy Stormgate Skirmish Tutorial will help you for a few minutes and then completely disappear, letting you ACTUALLY put the stuff you learned into practice.

-------------------------

But it's not only simple enough for a beginner, it's also complex enough for a veteran. I'm not a pro so I can't speak for those folks, but this has everything I want from a modern RTS. There are enough game modes and maps to keep me going for a while yet.

Then there's the different factions, who all have a different playstyle.

A lot of people compare this game to Warcraft/Starcraft.

Side note: Frost Giant are literally ex-Blizzard devs, so I'd be more surprised if it WASN'T compared to those two games.

I haven't had that experience. I can see why people say that, but to me this game feels more like Command and Conquer crossed with WH40K classic Dawn of War serie.

Vanguard are basically Space Marines, but they feel more like playing Red Alert 3 Soviet Russia than they do Starcraft Terrans.

Inferno are basically standard hell tropes, but they feel like playing a cross between SC2 Zerg and Age of Mythology Atlanteans.

Celestials are basically the answer to the question 'What if the Red Alert 3 Imperial Army used SC2 Protoss tech but dressed like WH40k's Eldar?'

I thought this game would feel like Starcraft 3. It doesn't. It feels more like a TC for Dawn of War - in all the right ways. The only way it feels even remotely Blizzard-esque is the fact that it has creeps (enemies used to rank up player units).

--------------------------------

The aesthetics are fine. I see nothing wrong with the graphics, all of the buildings and units look different enough that you can tell what's happening during a battle, which is all I care about. Star Trek Online might be gorgeous as hell, but that stops me from being able to see what's happening during most space battles.

The sound lacks a certain punch, especially on some of the larger units. But the game is still Early Access so I'm not too fussed about that.

---------------------------

There's a HUGE drawback to all of this: The game is live-service.

No internet? No game. That regularly affects me and I won't pretend otherwise.

But do they at least do all the live service things?

Thankfully yes. The game is regularly updated, the devs will listen to feedback (but they also make it clear when they won't, which I respect a lot more than radio silence), they're still adding quality of life stuff, there's currently a simple Halloween event - and so on.

It's very possible I'll get some clown awards because people will think I'm being a shill. I have no control over that.

What I do have control over is 'what games I choose to play'.

And Stormgate is now one of them. If you think about it: There's no higher accolade than that, really!",1728890299,2024-10-14 03:18:19

steam,176633337,"POST NECROLYTE REVIEW: The same stands as before--the game has great bones and the devs are continuing to deliver on their promise to incorporate player feedback when making the game.  The campaign release is great, all 12 missions were enjoyable, satisfyingly difficult and really fun to play.  I agree with some other that the pricing/bundle model is weirdly obtuse, but I'd say the campaign is absolutely worth the $25 (devs have since released campaign to be purchased as a Steam DLC).  There's loads of free features, no obscured currency, and no pay to win mechanics.  

My advice is to load up the game and give the first three levels of campaign a try, check out 1v1 and some of the custom maps and see if it's worth your time/money.  I advocate that it worth the money, and that the devs are cookin something special.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:The game has great bones, and the devs have thus far delivered on their promise to incorporate player feedback when making the game.  Their vision has been to make the game side-by-side with their players, meaning it's in a pretty raw state right now.  With that in mind, in its current state, this game isn't for everyone.  I'm having a blast with 1v1, and an occasional Co-op game.  If you dig 1v1 RTS, then I think this game is worth your time and money.

That said, the game still needs some time to cook.  Co-op, Team Mayhem (3v3 moba/RTS mix) and campaign aren't quite there yet.  I think they'll deliver on their promise--their communication style has been open and, honestly, refreshing.",1728399022,2024-10-08 10:50:22
steam,176591981,"The game is very unfinished. Many of the units do not have proper models, and the cinematics had clear visual and sound glitches. I ran into bugs in every level of the campaign. 

The units feel very clunky and get stuck to an even greater degree then in game like WC3. Combat feels incredibly unpolished. For example, when units carry out a ranged attack, It sometimes does not do damage  if you move while the projectile is mid air. (I noticed this on Amara)  
 
Some sound effects are very loud and obnoxious. 

The only positive thing I can say is that some of the missions are conceptually well designed.",1728340229,2024-10-07 18:30:29
steam,176583537,"(I have played the game more before EA, hence why my game time is so low)

Stormgate is currently a fun 1v1 RTS. It is the closest one gets to SC2 in terms of unit responsiveness.
What it is not currently is a good singleplayer experience.
Coop and especially the campaign lacks polish.

I don't recommend to play it for the singleplayer right now.

In any case, the game is free so I don't see why people are so mad that the game is unfinished. Contrary to a lot of titles, SG has a ""real"" EA where a lot of things are evolving.
I can say there were a lot of changes during alpha and they seem to increase the rate of new content and big updates.
It's nothing like the beta of SC2 WoL where Blizzard was very timid in their changes.

The game has a lot of potential and will become the new reference for RTS.

steam,176531995,"I recommend this as a free-to-play early access game with a lot of promise. Maybe wasn't a great marketing idea to release it to early access in such an unfinished state, though. As an early look at a game engine that could someday be the basis for many great single-player campaigns as well as online co-op competitive modes, it is great. As a fully-functional real-time strategy game? Definitely not so great. The campaign is not good as a campaign, but it is a decent tech demo of what their engine is capable of. It's not hard to imagine this becoming a good campaign based on the bones of what's here. But it's honestly silly for them to charge for the campaign at this point. I consider my $10 or whatever a donation to the cause because it was in no state to be sold. There's also essentially no onboarding for beginners, but if you have played other real-time strategy games then you'll figure it out easy enough. I think it feels pretty good and responsive, so it's got good bones. I just hope the game financiers stick with them long enough to let them build out an engaging campaign and some fun twists on multiplayer we haven't seen before.",1728259449,2024-10-06 20:04:09

I grew up on the original Blizzard RTS games, WarCraft 2, WarCraft 3, StarCraft, and StarCraft 2, and once I found out the original devs left corporate Blizzard and started their own studio (Frost Giant) I had hope. After playing for 9 hours, this game has serious potential. Races feel familiar with some mechanics and completely new tactics. Even in early access, the map graphics are way ahead of StarCraft 2 (which I still play to this day). This is the type of RTS I want and I'm willing to invest my money to supporting it. I've wanted a modern WarCraft 4 and StartCraft 3 for so long and this just might fill that void. Frost Giant, please don't let me down.",1728189074,2024-10-06 00:31:14

steam,176443905,"I'm not really a target audience of 1v1-PVP, so I'm there mostly for single-player content (but would consider going online later), and what I see now looks promising. I felt some Warcraft III vibes from the first two missions, which is always good. There are many many many things which need polish, but that's what it means to be in Early Access, so I don't understand so much demotivating negativity in the community. If I listened to all this 'ugly models/no facial animation' crap, I don't think I'd give Stormgate a go. With that said, I'm looking forward to some major updates and hopefully even a full-blown release, since I'm not the type of gamer to focus much on early access products. 

Do I recommend this game? It costs no money at this point, so if you are a fan of 2000's RTS and have appetite for modern iterations of the nearly-abandoned genre, then you absolutely should not ignore Stormgate's existence.

steam,176281091,"The game has a lot of issues. From sounds design, to unit impact. Now i am only a Co-op player and care little for the campaign or versus. the bits of campaign i have played felt plain, dry and boring. 

Now if we look at Co-op we can best compare it to SC2 Co-op where we have a outline of what Stormgates would like to achieve. At the moment they dont reach this in any way shape or form. The different heroes feel very boring and unimpactfull. You play with the same units as you'd do with the base version of the race. and maybe unlock a unqiue version of a unit if you leveled significantly. Compare that to SC2 where you have different unit types out of the gate (except for maybe a couple of main heroes -> Reynor, Kerrigan) but even those have different upgrades and evolved forms once you level up your hero. 
Which brings me to the next issue, leveling your hero feels like it doesnt really do anything instead of unlocking a new way to play you just repeat what you did before. 

Unto the leveling problem: In SC there is a clear interface which tells the player how much experience they earned and what bonuses they got based on difficulty or w/e. In Stormgate you get an amount X and need amount Y i dont know how far along the path i am to the next level and it feel super slow to get a level.

Then there is the mission availibilty and difficulty selection. 
About Difficulty: Brutal and hard to me feel the same i geuss maybe spawn rates increase i dont know. and the challenge rating above brutal didnt try them couldnt be bothered to be honest. as it doesnt seem to offer anything extra,
About the Maps/Mission: 6 maps, 3/4 mission types of which basicly all of them are straight SC ripoffs  most notably Dead of night. I dont know what its called in Stormgate, but its the same setup, same principle major(only) difference is there are 3 players instead of 2.

Lastely the toppic of mission pacing or gameplay pacing
The early game of stormgate is Super fast almost to fast. You need to build quickly and get a standing ""army"" pretty early to defend vs the first attack wave on either mission. But from early to mid the game falls flat pretty fast. you start massing your units but the AI doesnt really keep up or grows accordingly to game lenght, therefor you can sort of role over them this pacing difference from defence ""stress"" to offence boredom feels so bad. Here also come the sound design and unit design issues. Some units are really quite and some are loud but if you have an army of 1 unit or 100 units the sound is the same. And if there is multiple types of units you basicly only hear the loudest. Which makes it feel like there is only 1 unit fighting. it falls flat on its bum basicly it doesnt feel like you got this big army. 
To add to that most units abilities are on autocast and if they're not on autocast micro them feels worthless why? because they get stuck behind eachother or do odd pathing to use their abilities think getting caught in terrain just bumping into units instead of finding away around. Again it feels bad almost like you are controling SC1 units, which honestly felt better because at the time that was released the pathing was pretty good. 

Then we have the pricing. taking all this into consideration SC2 offers me heroes at approx 5 euros per hero with as mentioned above each its own playstyle and units and everything feels impactfull and unique. Where as in stormgate i pay 10 euros for a hero that barely feels different from the rest of the grey and uses the same units as the others. WHY WOULD I PAY MORE IF I GET LESS. 

To close of this rant:
Unless Stormgate fixes the game interms of pathing, sound design, control and well i havent talked about it but racedesign. i dont see why you should get this game on release or ever. Not as a PvP player, a campaign player or Co-op player. A 10 foot pole would be to short to touch this game. The game really has potential you can see it in every pixel that is on the screen (if its on the screen) but it requires a LOT of work still to unlock that potential.",1727957095,2024-10-03 08:04:55

steam,176132684,"The good:

The game has the BEST RTS engine and tick rate ever created. It feels much more responsive than SC2 (previous champion in that). Also has rollback to reduce lag even further. Technically it's the best RTS for e-sports, self-expression and smooth non-laggy play.

Ladder system incentivize to play more (you never lose points, only slow gain) and punishes new accounts (the gain is slow enough to prevent smurfing).

Coming from blizzard RTS you feel at home. Many similarities, easter eggs etc. You will get that blizzard-style feeling.

People are truly passionate about the game and constantly working on it. Blizzard abandoned SC/War3/SC2 long time ago. So it's the worst state this game could be in and only moves forward to the better as the time goes.

The bad:

Nobody plays it, nobody knows about it (not enough marketing), high expectations were destroyed on EA launch.

Pathfinding/pathing is pretty bad, they are working on it and it is improved since launch, but the problem is the lack of vision of what it should be. It feels too smart to its own detriment (e.g. attack priority on certain units makes some units chase them and not attacking others), workers who can attack run away from fights by default, etc. STUPID BUT PREDICTABLE is much better strategy IMHO.

Quick build panel is awful and lets you do much less things compared to not using it. You don't control which worker is selected, no multi-worker build, woker runs up see there's no place to build and goes back, you can't cancel this command etc. etc.

Sound design is not enough so far, quality of sounds, levels etc.

Unit and faction design is bad so far. Only vanguard is okay, other factions lack a lot of things.

Celestials almost ignore the map, most ""bull**it feeling"" faction, makes some quit 1v1 because of their unfair-feeling mechanics. Even if they are balanced they would be always perceived as imbalanced. Worse than Protoss.

Infernals are just boring, they need more cool exciting abilities that destroy things or create cool-looking things.

QoL features missing, like if you start build menu with worker you can't cancel and make it attack. You can't cancel ""return"" ability of the transport. You accidentally salvage buildings because you don't have to ""hold"" and each missclick destroys it eventually. Even in AoE to delete worker you have to hold the key. Y for cancel, ESC for menu is strange. Should be ESC for cancel and F10 for menu if it's blizzard style RTS.

Performance. Almost all of my ""starcraft-friends"" can't play it because they have potato PC or business laptop. There's no problem running SC2 on low or BW remastered but with this game you actually need 8 core CPU and something a least like 2060 GPU. I've tried it with listed 1060 3GB and 4 core CPU and performance was awful, constant stuttering on low graphics. With this they eliminate another population of players.

Lack of soul and excitement. Hard to describe, but mostly related to graphics, WOW effect, unique units. This does feel like Aliexpress Starcraft + Warcraft. They can use Dota2 and LoL heroes for inspiration of cool things in the game.

Community ""teaches"" them too much. Feels like they lack vision on some things and collective mind drives some decisions.",1727757985,2024-10-01 00:46:25

The Ai portrait talking in campaign is uncanny valley, I would've preferred static portrait instead. Coop is still dead. I feel like they forgot to hire a proper game designer. It just too bland and generic. 

EA:
Backed $60 dollar KS because i thought it was ""fully funded"". I am confused where the $40 million dollars went. Only took them 4 years for them to realize the art style is trash. There is 0 innovation in the ""next-gen social RTS"". The gameplay is just too slow and boring. I have maxed every commander in sc2 coop w/ prestiage but SG coop is just a snooze. Every commander feels to similar to base faction. There is no ""cool"" factor to the game. Early Access is not excuse for a bad game.

steam,176072486,"This game has an identity crisis.

Make no mistake, there are a lot of ideas copied from other games. But do they work together?
I don't know - and the developers also don't know. By this stage, they should have a clearer picture of where the want the game to go. They have demonstrated that they require a lot of community feedback for their game - and it's not only for balance but for design. This is reflected by the content that have copied from other games. It seems like the developers are trying to impress everyone by including everything, and they lean on the community to streamline their decisions. There are things where player feedback is necessary, such as execution and balance. But not knowing what to focus their development time on? That falls on management. We SHOULDN'T need to tell the developers we want better textures or improved performance.

This game is very early access. I'd call it Earliest Access. There are blurry textures, shoddy animations, missing sounds, and all of it is topped by poor system performance (for the graphical fidelity). There are promises of improved graphics, performance, content, new game modes, campaign missions, Coop Missions, heroes, and tons of other things. It really seems like they will deliver on their promises. But when?

In the meantime, they highlight all the FREE stuff they give us. Like a FREE comic on the backstory, a FREE exhibition stream on Twitch, and some free coop missions and modes. It reeks of desperation. A free comic isn't going to hype up a subpar product. Also selling overprice microtransactions like a Fog of War shader, when your default graphics looked like the original Warcraft 3? Get your product together first, then push the other stuff.

They released a Major Update on September 17 on Steam. Come to find out, the Major Update is actually just a blog post on more promises coming in version 0.1. But there's no set date for version 0.1. We don't even know if it's this year. I think it's deceptive to mark the game as having a Major Update without actually releasing a patch. They repeatedly write posts in a misleading way as if the changes are in effect. Example, in a post on September 18th - they titled it 'Stormgate's First Early Access Content Update'. The description says: ""You can play for free on Steam this Thursday, September 19!"" as if the update goes live on the 19th. When actually, it's just reiterating that the game is open access.

Ultimately, we see that player interest is dwindling. This doesn't mean this game can't achieve greatness one day, but players don't want to wait around for it. Personally, I don't like their passive development style. I don't like the desperation in their posts. I don't like the promises they put out with no idea of release in sight. But still, I want to see the game succeed.",1727674165,2024-09-30 01:29:25
steam,176061379,"so in early access, it played more like warcraft 3 and wasnt very good. it was almost good. but not great. the changes they made recently changed that and now it plays much more like the spiritual successor to sc2 it was meant to be. I really like the direction they took it. If you're a guy like me, looking to play a new version of sc2 this is your game. i wouldn't have said that during early access, but i would say that about the game i played today sept 29th 2024. celestial is protoss, infernal is zerg, vanguard is terran. they did make some cool changes. i like that the terran faction is the one that has carriers. i like that the celestial (toss) are mobile and can strike early on in the game. I think they need to upgrade the zerg faction (infernal) as they seem kind of lackluster rn compared to the other two, but judging by the changes they made between early access and now, theyre clearly listening to the community so I have hope/faith this game will be updated and cared for accordingly as time goes on and people give feedback. the fact the developers are listening means a lot. I reccomend this game to any sc2 vets that are desperately searching for its spiritual successor. this game really scratches that itch. the hotkey system is amazing too.

edit: still in EA didnt realize, that was just an update. one more thing ill say, the terran faction is very underpowered. Zerg faction is very OP. suits me just fine tho, Im a Zerg player",1727655449,2024-09-29 20:17:29
steam,176058516,"It may be free, but that doesn't mean anything when it isn't fun.

There is no redeeming quality to this. The graphics are clearly in an alpha state, which is not what a game in Early Access should be at. The devs don't seem to know what audio mixing is. The menus are trash. The game takes WAY too long to load for a game that looks like this on a computer that can play two simultaneous copies of Cyberpunk 2077.

I can get past all of that, though, if the game were fun. If only. The A.I. only understands how to rush which gets old quickly. Your troops are neurologically divergent and need you to baby them through movement and firefights, why are we still dealing with that garbage in 2024. There is very little feedback as to what is happening in a fight and where. 

Why have an idle worker button that is so small I didn't even find it until my fourth skirmish, that also doesn't take you to the worker in question? Do you know...games...Frost Giant?

This has no redeeming qualities. The campaign is pathetic, the gameplay is pathetic...oh, but I'm sure it'll be fine. These guys have Fog of War Shaders! I'm not joking...Fog of War Shaders...

In future, try making a good game, Frost Giant. THEN you'll make money...

steam,176040535,"Good bones but a lot to improve. I think the gameplay mechanics are interesting and challenging. There's much to do in the game and I think the story and Codex make for a great story for the campaign to begin.

The issue with this game as of 2024 09 29 is that there are fourth wall breaking problems. A lack luster replay system which makes learning how to improve difficult is a major issue for the hardcore competitive RTS community. I think the cinematics need polish but apparently that is being worked on. A lack of in game resources to go read more technical aspects about a unit, structure, or other concept because it is not available in replays means I have to start a private AI game to go read or try and navigate a fan wiki that is sometimes good and sometimes not. Couple these issues with a more Micro-transaction based payment system for things in-game to get core content and it is tragic for a game that I think has great promise based off of what I've seen.


I think this game is on it's way to greatness. I think the art style is different but not too different, and the first update really added a lot. I purchased the deluxe pack because the first update gave me a confidence boost in the game's future and I want to support developers who stand up to massive monopoly game companies run by people who don't care about what video games can be. I hope members of the RTS community don't give up on this studio and the game just yet. I would play it, buy some small things for yourself, and give the developers feedback about what you don't like and some time. I really like multiplayer compared to other RTS games.

steam,176000173,"Wow, this game has come a long way since my last review, and it definitely deserves an update.
I’d say it’s finally in a playable state — the state I imagined early access would deliver when it first launched. I just hope it’s not too late, and I’m not talking into an empty room.

The Good
Amara is finally fixed — in so many ways.
She’s basically a model now. Maybe they could dial it back just a smidge, but I’ll take this over what we had before any day. I actually find myself loving how expressive her new portrait is during mission dialog (center-left of the screen). Admittedly, something about it still feels a bit off — maybe a touch too cartoony or uncanny — but honestly, I’d be fine if it stayed like this.

And her voice? Sounds like a real human now, which is huge.
She speaks slowly and conversationally. There’s still room for polish, but it’s a massive improvement. If I had to rate her voice acting on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 1 being awful and 10 being top-tier like StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty or Warcraft III), the original was a 1.5 at best. Now? I’d say it’s a solid 8.

More importantly, the dialog and tone give her room for a proper character arc — which is exciting.
She could become a badass, battle-hardened leader after some key defeats, leading the vanguard like a female Raynor. Or maybe they’ll twist it and go for an Arthurian arc. Either way, it finally feels like there's enough runway for this plane to take off.

Pathing – 60–70% fixed
This was my biggest issue, and it's definitely improved. Units don’t feel horribly clunky anymore, but there’s still a frustrating problem: if you try to micro a single unit (say, Amara at 5% health) and others are behind her, they refuse to move. Like, I imagine her yelling “Let me through! Let me through!” and the others just stare blankly and say, “If you don't stand your ground and fight, you don’t deserve to live.”

In all seriousness: friendly units should be able to nudge each other aside, especially small infantry. I get that a siege tank or deployed Atlas is basically a structure and shouldn’t move — but everyone else should.

Other Notes & Suggestions
We’re not quite at what Blizzard would call alpha, but we’re close.

Lip sync needs work, especially for the guy giving the missions.

Dialog options need reordering logic — I shouldn't be locked out of speaking to someone just because I haven’t talked to the orders-guy first.

Campaign upgrades feel trivial — +10% damage, +attack speed, +health. Where are the new mechanics? No jumping Baneling equivalents, no unique variants like a Goliath. Upgrade trees are great, but they mean more when you’re making meaningful decisions — not just choosing stat buffs.

Missions need outros. Even a simple “Great work everyone — they’ll think twice before underestimating us” followed by a victory screen would help tremendously. It’s weird because I think they had that in a previous build.

Inventory management — let me drag and drop items to storage, please. Whatever’s there now is clunky.

Overall: this game is finally shaping up into something that matches its potential. Here's hoping it's not too little, too late.",1727588575,2024-09-29 01:42:55

I also truly respect that they are trying to bring back the RTS genre. I'm done with SC2 and WC3, and I'm looking for something new to scratch the RTS itch.
One thing to note is that I am a single-player RTS player about 90% of the time. So I was mainly playing the campaign and doing the Co-op missions solo. The toxic online environment of SC back in the day scarred me permanently as a teen so I don't play multi-player.

Balance is still a work in progress, some units are still struggling to find their unique/iconic identity and place in the meta, and units can sometimes get stuck pathing around enemies, but none of that is critical.

steam,175877734,"I like setting up comp stomps to entertain myself - me versus a couple bots, maybe with a bot ally.  

This game is frustrating to me because your allied bot takes EVERY single last resource from you, including mining from luminite mines you have loaded with your own guys.  I spend as much time fighting my ally for resources as I do fighting the enemy.

Enemy bots will go charging through your allied base to kill you explicitly - and they always 100% chance know where you are from game start.  Will your ally come help?  Of course not.  

So it means if you set up an allied computer, expect it to be a complete obstruction to playing.  I guess they only want 1v1 matchups?

If they did something about the absolutely terrible bot behavior, then I'd be happy playing.  As of now, this isn't worth the frustration.

---

Update 2/16/25
----

New basic maps added, allied bot still has zero respect for mines you have already claimed or any space in which you're building.  The bot will frequently trap its own troops behind buildings with bad build location decisions and you have to rescue their troops - that is if you feel like bothering, since the allied bot only builds satellite bases and never enough troops to adequately defend itself in the first place.  It just runs around and builds satellite bases.

All strategy required - lots of basic ranged troops and artillery.  

Whenever the celestial faction is in play - either as a bot or yourself - my game hard crashes, and I need to reverify/redownload game files through right click/properties/verify game files.  It downloads something each time, but apparently some file is consistently corrupted.  Having to run a file check every time I play is aggravating.

What is this sad and pathetic campaign? I thought this was a game and games were supposed to be fun.

First cinematic where the main guy couldn't understand the villain's goal of opening a portal while refusing the order to close it was cringe af enough. Please stop making double digit iq main characters already.

Later on we face with another cinematic with a sad woman holding a necklace or something. What the hell is this kdrama? Why is everything so pathetic?

I mainly wishlisted this project because I read that it's from some of the people who left Starcraft 2. I thought it was the incompetent bunch. I didn't even get to play it, I quit at the cinematic, it is that bad. I don't want a game that I play as dumb sad people.",1727364588,2024-09-26 11:29:48

StarCraft 2 was a sign that RTS cannot survive on the wallets of a few dozen pay pigs. The ex StarCraft 2 developers failed to see that sign. This is the result of not learning from your own history.

I bought this expecting  a game inspired by Starcraft and trying to be it but having a different take design and over all look to it. well after b having been curious and stupid enough to buy this game. I found out why the Low reviews. First lets talk about the game itself the story? trash but that not to be unexpected What sucks is while this story is trash so is the Ai for the Units in the game itself. You like Body Blocking and watching units clambour over one another trying to do a simple task of mobbing up together to beat a single guy like the OLD Starcraft Broodlord days?

ya got it this game has plenty of that AI  Path finding in this game is brain damaged Clicking them to move over here on the map or across  a bridge or around a  tree and you're gonna have a fun time watching them try to process how to do that. on top of that Unit quotes and voice acting is.. not good but besides that they also just rip quotes and commentary straight out of Starcraft 2. ""In rear with the Gear"" ""ahh you scared me!"" but without the charm and love that those voice actors put into it for those units. On top of that the design of the factions and the units themselves? Sucks. You've got Totally not Terrans, The  Demon over lords that are totally not Zerg, and then The  totally not protoss no these guys are angels! but.. they  have literally the exact same design and feel for them. jesus christ man I get you wanted to do starcraft 2  But ""Better"" but there is a difference between totally inspired by and Just a Bootleg. on top of that this game does nothing new nothing interesting nothing fun. they introduced a total of two new mechanics which they got from dota 2 or any other moba game with capturing this tower to hold vision but also tall grass now that you can set units inside of to hide in till they burst out ready to ambush and attack things but again.. ai not very smart. This is literally  starcraft 2 but done extremely poorly . On top of that You wanna  play with a  certain faction hero guess what these greedy game devs did? did someone say  Ingame shop requiring you to buy commanders units for 4.99? yes? if so CORRECT you TOO  can spend money to unlock more commander hero units to use for whatever faciton you're wanting to play!.. GREAT! just what we wanted! waste our money on stupid fucking heroes instead of just having all the commander units in the game already but no nickle and dime FFS. other fun tid bits about this game. there is no restart button for missions in story. if you fail or wanna restart you have to hit quit exit the mission htne click abck in. there is no way to skirmish against ai by yourself lest you make your own lobby and  fight the bots yourself but there is no just skirmish against the bots mode. all anda ll not worth the money.",1727146320,2024-09-23 22:52:00

steam,175579558,"I was hyped for this game, especially after I heard that OG ex-Blizz employees are working on it. Sadly, it’s easily one of the worst strategy games I've ever experienced. I usually quit games I don’t like after about 50-100 hours, but with this one, it took half an hour.

The UI, menu, etc., is almost a carbon copy of StarCraft II, which isn’t bad in itself, but the game is way worse than SC2. Here are a few reasons why:

- Forced diversity in this ""intergalactic"" location or whatever; I honestly could care less.
- Terrible art direction. Is this a 6+ game for kids?
- Units look uninspiring and awful; even the names are terrible.
- It feels like I’m playing a strategy game where ""strategy"" barely exists. Everything is automated.
- Laggy as hell (how can this POS lag???)
- Feels like a scuffed StarCraft II.
- Barely any real unit variety.
- Autospending and autobuilding are terribly balanced.
- A scuffed carbon copy of SC2 in terms of units and races.
- No innovation, no interesting mechanics, no interesting story, and nothing worth talking about.

Keep in mind I’ve waited for this game since it was announced. 
I might’ve liked it if I had a smooth brain and downs.

Now the question is: Who was this game designed for, and why would anybody play it?

The answer is, it’s designed for nobody, and nobody is playing it—500 active players right now. I’m not a massive SC2 fan, but after six years of not playing SC, this game made me ragequit and start up SC2. It’s a worse version of the game it tried to copy, and there is no reason to ever play it or choose it over SC2. Even though it’s early access, there is no way they will fix anything in time. They would have to start all over again.

Overall, this game is a huge disappointment and will never achieve anything in the gaming market. There is no audience for such an unrefined, brainless children's comic strategy game.

Even if the devs fix most problems with the game, it will never surpass the mediocrity it’s stuck with. The best this game could achieve with perfectly focused updates would be a 5/10.

Since the way units move around and the management of these units is pretty smooth, I would still give it a SCORE: 3/10.

The Good stuff:
- Fun and responsive gameplay!
- Passionate dev-team that listens to feedback.
- Great potential.

The Bad Stuff:
- Still in EA so most things need more work.
- Currently lacking something unique that sets it apart from similar games.
- Campaign has some interesting missions but is currently not worth playing. Too unfinished at this stage.

END OF EA REVIEW - - - - - - - Below is how I feel now:

The game is better than ever. It is hyper-responsive (at least matching the level of Starcraft 2) great performance and looks great visually! The developers have spent the past year listening to feedback and are dead-set on improving the game indefinitely. From my experience with the progress they've made each patch I am sure Stormgate will be regarded among the greats in the genre, and can eventually evolve into something truly unique. And this release is already a solid baseline.

The campaign was completely overhauled - the new story and gameplay elements are a massive improvement. The competitive 1v1 mode has been blessed with a map obective (stormgates) that really sets this apart from other RTS titles, and makes Stormgate something worth playing on its own merits. There is also a new section called ""sigma labs"" where we get a glimpse of new game modes to come, including their powerful terrain editor, co-op and various custom games.

This is a unique chance for RTS veterans and newcomers to be part of the future of the genre. For anyone in doubt: anything is free to try, even the first 3 missions of the campaign so I recommend checking it out and making up your own mind.",1727035178,2024-09-22 15:59:38

As someone who’s played hundreds of hours in SC2 co-op and maxed out all commanders, I was excited to play this game. However, I have to say that the pricing model feels scammy. The price for heroes is way too high for the value we are getting right now. I’ve already seen $70 worth of stuff in the cash shop, but only about $10 of that is for skins—this is still early access, mind you! 

On the plus side, I do like the changes to Amara... Hopefully, we’ll see more updates like that to make the game more appealing.

Updating this review for the Ashes of Earth release. I just finished the full campaign on Brutal today, and while it's not the most perfectly paced campaign in the world, every mission feels unique, and has its own interesting little thing to it, and it's FUN! If you want the challenge, the back half of the campaign on brutal does get BRUTAL, but now that I'm done with that, I'm eager to go get the rest of the achievements I'm missing from this campaign on some lower difficulties, and the randomized elements about item drops and some of the research upgrades you can do between missions make it replayable enough that I'm not worried about getting bored with it.

1v1 isn't exactly balanced yet, but content-wise, it's getting to a very exciting place, and they seem to be working hard on it.

As we continue on this journey, let's support them in creating an RTS that balances casual fun with strategic depth, knowing that they can deliver.",1726846790,2024-09-20 11:39:50

steam,175376077,"The game looks very similar to Starcraft 2. I've played mostly campain in SC2 and here after the second tutorial campain I have to purchase 2 missions for 24 EUR or 1 for 10 EUR. I dont mind the unfinished look of the game, but I wont pay that amount for 1-2 missions only. Yes, you pay for the game but still. Probbaly bigger fans of the game genre wont mind that price, but for my region this is a lot. I've tried custom game vs bots. It's ok for learning the game. The helper bot is a bit of an idiot, but it helped me to see what I need to build. Anyway the game looks ok-ish for what I was able to see from the two tutorial missions. The story is a bit flat (a female Artas finds burning peace of deamon themed Frostmourne), but I guess it will get better. The intro cinematic was good.

steam,175351452,"Now dead honest, i think the games fun i do but theres so few units which do make the game easier that countering a unit becomes so much harder and some times a lot more expensive. I do think the game is not balanced in terms of factions or races. I specifically point this toward the vanguard, as they have the best macro unit in the game, known as the exos that are extremely cheap to build 125/50, that arent fair, and every single player abuses that fact making the game really boring as its always a battle against a massive army of macro enhanced units if you get their tier 1 upgrade that costs 100/100 making it so that every time they go into combat they get a 25% speed bonus, ive personally looked into several counters as well as upgrades to counter them, and it becomes such an expense to counter the exos to the point that you will lose because the units needed cost so much and arent able to kill enough to be viable, the game is super awesome totally recommend i will gladly change my review once the game gets more balanced and becomes a lot funner again, but until then all i see is the same repetitive army over and over, that always wins in combat, and if you try to counter attack, their is a 25 costing ability that always charges during the game, that gives the basic worker units 50% attack damage and 50 armor, which is more than all of my units armor in the early game when its mostly tier one and 2 units. but thats my take, i loved starcraft 2 and its flexibility in units to counter other units, i want to love this game more but its not enjoyable when one race clearly dominates the others, its just the people that play them emphasize the tier 2 and 3 units that cant compare in strength to exos.",1726809232,2024-09-20 01:13:52

steam,175152648,"Ok, I really didn't want to give review because would probably be negative and I didnt want to be a hater but now ill post my review in short.

Campaign is bad, lackluster.
Co-op is worse sc2 copy.
Social rts without possibility to even send message to the person who you played with, what about clans and more stuff.
Next gen without nothing innovative. Literally copy-paste gameplay starcraft 2 but bad, nothing unique that someone will say : damn, thats sick.
In wc3 you have camps and they are important because they have heroes with xp and items. Here you have camps because of what ?

Many stuff like social stuff, balance and t3 can be implemented but they dont listen any feedback.
Many pros give feedback about races, about camps, about boring units design and they just ignored.
They have feedback from years about the graphics and other stuff that they just refuse to listen.

If you are co-op player just go play sc2, its cheaper, its better.
You want campaign ? Just go play sc2 or wc3, they even better custom campaigns.
1v1 ? - just go play sc2 its like 100 times better.

The game is bad but shop is working good.
I really wanted to give positive review and recomend this game, but devs need to learn somehow.
If they dont start making drasting changes, this game is so dead. 
And finally, I dont recomend this game.

It's not exciting to watch or play. There is no clear direction. The ""fun"" of 1v1 is absent or, at best, not obvious at all. I fear that many of the things that make 1v1 a drag are the things Frost Giant has done on purpose to try to attract casuals to the rts genre, and that unfortunately means they will not backtrack on these issues.

steam,175082811,"Still in development, I'm sure much will change. Some things are cool, some not, some good, some bad. Overall, Its getting there. I say all this with the upmost respect for this game and the developers. I played the beta months ago, its nice to see the progress made. I think certain sounds need redesign / correct leveling / some sounds need to be compressed etc. Basic RTS functions like 'townhall' jump camera hotkey, double tapping all army to camera jump at your army instead of having to use hotkeys to jump camera on army, and hotkey set ups for most functions in the game are generally either very specific and or limited like the developer said you must play the game this way, because everyone else is, or they just haven't polished these things in yet and i'm a spoil rotten RTS gamer just for having these expectations. There is limited hotkey personalizing is my point. That being said I just use hot keys for my army and camera hot keys for my bases so its playable, just needs these functions to have polished feel and players will be able to get used to the game having these normal RTS functions. Also I'm going to say something about it: the quick build function is limited in its use. RTS players already have everything organized in their mind how they will hotkey everything they need, and lower level players using it are honestly confusing themselves and probably better off learning how to play an RTS the way it should be played. Grabbing a worker and building buildings. Hotkeying production buildings and building units. Learn the nuances of a build and which worker you grab to maximize income etc. Unless you are Celestial then quick build is useful only while your townhall is upgrading and you can't grab a worker or don't have one hotkeyed. At least personally for me, unless all this criteria were met I never used this 'new and innovative function of RTS' in the heat of a sweaty RTS game.
That all comes before balance and don't get me started... everyone say it with me now!
Nerf Scouts please! ... and whatever that black hole thing is Celestial's have that needs nerf, its like psystorm that keeps you sucked into the pain and its awful and should never exist and gives me nightmares...
... and maybe Infernals could use some buffs if these nerfs to the other races aren't enough... but you didn't hear that from me.
As much as I'm grilling, I do really like this game and playing Vangaurd. I recommend this game to other RTS players and basically that means people who know how to use a keyboard. Not you kids out there who only know how to use touch screens even though that's what they are trying to market this game to with the 'Fortnightish' art style vs the SC2 realism. What do I know though... who am I to judge...
Thank you for all the hard work and effort on this game Frost Giant!
Thank you for whoever got this far in the review!
Have a great day and GLHF!

steam,175070347,"Give it another 6-12 months to bake.

[i]Stormgate[/i] isn't a bad game, but there's really nothing that sets it apart right now either. The devs have been very up front that they want it to be a spiritual successor to [i]StarCraft 2[/i], but they've been so focused on that that it lacks any identity of its own. It feels like what you'd get if you took the mechanics of [i]StarCraft 2[/i], added a sprinkle of creep farming from [i]WarCraft 3[/i], and switched out the races for less edgy versions of the factions in [i]Diablo[/i].

Even the campaign plot feels like it's ripped straight from [i]WarCraft 3[/i]. [spoiler]There's a cursed sword (or set of swords in this case) that the protagonist believes to be the key to defeating the Infernals, but in her singleminded pursuit of it she begins to drive away her companions and lose her humanity.[/spoiler] I don't mind a game paying homage to its predecessors, and it's clear that there's a lot of desire for a new Blizzard-style RTS. But [i]Stormgate[/i] feels like it just lacks any originality, with every little detail having been done before in a Blizzard RTS, and often done better. It brings to mind the ""we have X at home"" meme.

The art style is quite unappealing. To be fair, the opening cinematic was actually pretty cool, but even there the character models look terrible. Frost Giant has acknowledged the complaints about this and say that they're still polishing and will be making improvements, but that they think the ""stylized"" approach is right for them. But I don't think anyone has a problem with a stylized approach per se; SC2 is also stylized. It's just that the particular style they've chosen, mainly for units, is kind of ugly and doesn't fit the tone of the universe (at least in campaign). Most units look like plastic toys, or in the case of some of the Infernals, melted wax candles. But at this point I don't think it would be financially feasible to make drastic changes here even if they wanted to.

Finally, and most importantly, is the gameplay, and unfortunately it's nothing amazing either. I have mainly played the campaign so far, and it was a mixed bag. The first two missions were very boring. The remaining four were better, but still not great; I'm struggling to even remember which parts I liked and which I didn't (it has been a while since I played them). Lately I've been playing [i]Age of Mythology Retold[/i], and it has reminded me how fun a good RTS campaign can be. [i]Stormgate[/i] is nowhere near that.

I haven't played PvP yet; I'm a fairly mediocre RTS player and the current state of [i]Stormgate[/i] PVP doesn't appeal to me. Frost Giant were trying to make it more accessible to ""casuals"" than SC2 was, but from the gameplay I've watched so far it looks even more cheesy and unbalanced.

I backed [i]Stormgate[/i] on Kickstarter, and I really wanted it to succeed. I love RTS, and we need a fresh new game to bring in new players and revitalize the genre. I still have some hope that [i]Stormgate[/i] can eventually live up to that, but right now, this ain't it.",1726456404,2024-09-15 23:13:24

Some tactical decisions makes it refreshing. Units, maps, tracking, campaign all have some remnant of potential to look and feel better. Thats the thing though, in its current form its a broken, small, and uninspiring game. Would've should've could've type of type of thing. I understand the early access dilemma but this game is not early access ready. Its an alpha demo at best. I bought the lowest tier and then decided to buy the rest of the campaign but I cannot. I have to pay the full price again and there is no upgrade version. Never seen anything like this before. And man that story. Its like a child watched all the clips from Starcraft and Warcraft on YT and wrote a short summary story and slapped it on this game. Why recycle old stories instead of making something new? The company could've hired a writer and come up with something original. Everyone in this space knows that legendary RTS with life long players requires a great campaign. It is possible to reinvent the wheel and still stick what has been tried and true. Fix the darn DLC so we can upgrade the game if we want to. At this point its a big No for me.

Although the game is free to play it only provides you with 3 missions and 1v1/3v3 PVP mode. And 2 characters in co-op mode. Everything else need to be bought separately which is kind of scummy. Especially since the devs have made so much money already, they don't need to be so aggressive in the monetization.

The right way to approach feedback is questioning why things are how they are, instead of just blindly hating what exists currently.

My own experience: I've played only a few matches and some of the campaign, and there is a lot that feels off intuitively if you've mainly played SC:BW and SC2. Thats the only way I can succinctly put it.

steam,174703048,"As a long time fan of Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3, I had high hopes for this game. And they've fallen flat.

At early access launch, there's 3 playable campaign missions which only play you through the barracks units, unless you're smart enough to steal an enemy mech bay in mission 3. There is no meta-progression in the campaign (yet), so bonus objectives do literally nothing other than tick a 'yay, you did it!' box. The missions themselves aren't great as a tutorial, in that they really didn't teach me anything about my units, other than that one is melee, one is a light scout melee, and 1 has a gun. Building upgrades just aren't explained, they're just there. Upgrade command center? When should I do that? Upgrade the supply depots? When did those even get an upgrade button? The campaign makes the mistake of both throwing too much at you at once while also not giving you enough info about the things its introducing.

Beating that, the game prompts you with a '10$ for chapter 1 now!'. Which, I get it. Free to play. They need $$ to make the game. But I'm not going to blindly shell out 10$ a chapter indefinitely for a mediocre campaign where the cutscenes play at 12 frames per second and the audio bugs and just cuts out. Not just mediocre in production value, it's mediocre in writing. '20 years ago, mankind was making a hell portal, but for controlled tests, until a madman opened the portal and flooded the earth with demons! Now we're fighting a war for survival as the resistance, and there's this weird blade artifact thing that gives the main character visions! Spooky!' I've written first drafts that were more compelling. There's no charm, no nuance, and I couldn't tell you anything about the three main human characters. Literally nothing. They all feel like cardboard cutouts, resistance fighters, willing to fight to the last to save mankind! 

Pathing is bad. League of Legeds figured it out. Heroes of the storm figured it out. Starcraft 2 figured it out. If you're going to make an RTS, or a game that plays like one, clean unit pathing has to be a massive priority. Having units behind the firing line just spinning in circles because they can't wrap and encircle the enemy properly is frustrating, and properly flanking an enemy with a larger force requires a level of micro control that just isnt necessary in smoother games.

This is not a great launch. Stormgate is actively competing with Star Craft 2, and as long as SC2 exists in a playable state, this just isn't making the bar for a competition. On the bright side, it made me want to play SC2 again, so I've been doing that.

TL:DR give this game time in the oven. Maybe the devs are working on making this into a masterpiece, but this? This ain't it chief, and the price tags necessary to access all the content don't inspire confidence. I hate to say it but I don't think they'll be able to pull it off.",1726017336,2024-09-10 21:15:36

(With out too much Spoiler) Story thus far starts 20 years in the games past showing how the world came to be. The main character is tied to one of the members at the facility when the events started. Now in a world where humans are on the brink of extinction, You lead a resistance group in fighting back and locating relics. 
Building seems well developed with unit upgrades and building upgrades. I am interested to see if there is any improvements this Company can make on an already existing genre of games.

This is definitely not an successor of StarCraft 2 or WarCraft 3 but... Game has potential... Well, kind of... I played early beta for a while and I was extremely dissapointed. When the game went into official ""early access game"" so it's available for everybody I can say I see alot of improvements however the game is still meh... For me if I would be honest... It's an slow paced meh 2024 RTS game - don't get me wrong, I love RTS games, it has been always my top 1 game genre but... But It's the only RTS game that came out recently so it's like try StormGate or try nothing.

So, what we actually got there? It's an mix of Starcraft 2 (races) and Warcraft 3 (gameplay style) but unfortunately instead of taking a speed from Starcraft 2 and the abilities from Warcraft 3 they went totally different way and gave you the speed of Warcraft 3 and the abilities of Starcraft 2 which ended into a beginners friendly RTS game. Well, is it bad? Yes! No... Not really. People are not into RTS these days so I doubt fast paced RTS game would attract more players as 99% of people doesn't even know what RTS is. The graphics even for an RTS games is kinda medium for 2024 and the graphics has the very cartoon style (I hate these kinds of graphics but It's just my personal opinion as these graphics are very common these days so I will skip this umm... ""issue"" in the final rating), and the music is nothing special aswell, I can't recognize any good track there during my 3 hours of gameplay while making the review. I won't rate the balance for now as the game is very fresh and I'm pretty sure that everything will change pretty quickly there.

Summarizing I would say it's not as bad as I thought. Developers changed alot since the 2023 early public beta (or alpha?) game. But it's still just an beginner friendly RTS game comparing to giants like Starcraft. The game has potential as it's kind of Starcraft/Warcraft game but the units are a way too slow, and all I could see was just a (death)balls of units fighting each other without any micro implemented. Super boring. The game is kinda fun but it's a definitely slow paced RTS game atleast in it's current status. Good for beginners casual RTS players, kinda boring for the veterans that expected a bit more faster action packed RTS game.

[b]Final Rating: 4/10[/b] - I would give it mixed rating as I kinda enjoyed it but it's definitely not on the same level or even close to Starcraft or Warcraft. I can rate either negative or positive so I will just stick to the negative atleast for now but the game has potential. With some gameplay/increased speed/balance upgrades I could rate the game 7/10. It seems like it will be never as fun as Starcraft used to be but... It can be fun if developed (updated) properly as I see huge improvements when I compare 2023 gameplay to 2024 gameplay.",1725932395,2024-09-09 21:39:55

Original comment after 11h
TLDR: i have not played enough yet but i have loved every minute i spent on the game. It brings me back the feelings i had when playing Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3. It's far from flawless but i think it's on the right track.

I'll start with the bad (keep in mind it's still an early release):
- campaign is very short, and in the cutscenes, the mouth of the characters is not animated, but frostgiants are working on the lip sync.
- there is no 2v2... Pity, it was my favourite mode in SC2
- it is also very expensive for what it is at the moment. I guess that with the ultimate edition, I'll have a total of 12 fairly short missions, that's a bit much, but I'm assuming it's to help the game be alive
- coop is limited to 3vAI. 2vAI would be good
- balance is a WIP (but the devs are listening to the players)
- I don't understand what the paid heroes are for: everybody seem to have access to them for free in coop, no?

Now the good:
- you get similar feelings as when playing old SC2 and Warcraft 3
- there are some cool ideas, like some shortcuts to access all building or all infantry training. If you decide to build something, the AI will automatically select one of your builders for that and will assign it to the task and it will go back to mining afterwards. It helps with micro management for old people like le
- you gain energy and can use that for additional powers
- while the vanguard is fairly straightfoward, the two other factions are quite different
- I'm looking forward to continue playing it 😁",1725865852,2024-09-09 03:10:52

Some lacking features, like save files for the campaign, or animations are missing which they say they will add at a later date. But definitely playable and enjoyable.

However, the main issue that might keep me away from the game is the pricing.

In Game: Bad Units with no build time. Feels like playing Whack a mole to win a game. 
Angels:
Nearly destroyed and clinging on to arc ships ( warhammer much?)
in Game: Units do either to much or no damage. Clearly Protoss inspired wich is not bad but doesnt fit the lore and or Gameplay at all.

Sound design is awefull. Ok Beta yada yada yada but it breaks the immersion if a gatling sounds like a peeshooter.
Lasers sound like they do no damage and have no wound up.

Grafics: 
finaly an improvement but the art style is horrible. Playing with Plastic Troops would be fine if the lore doesnt make it sound like warhammer. Either griddy up the Units and Maps or rewrite the lore to something more like Overwatch or Concorde ( remember concorde? No? same with StormGate if nothing changes).

Units in General feels like a random generator was used to come up with it. You have: Guy with Sword for melee, Guy with Gun for DPS. Woman with Heal, Ghost but not Ghost and Scout wich is bad at scouting.
For Mech you have: Helion but either on Steriods or Meth, Siege Tank but bad, Vulcan is a fine frontline unit that costs way to much and gets yoinked by the Inferals almost instantly..

For Air you have: Medivac without Medi wich makes it boring and under used, Science Vessel, The Wraith and the heli carrier wich is a clusterfuck of 2 Units that were already badly designed in sc2. 

For Infernals you have:

Generic bad Footssoldiers, Generic Zerg Flyers, for Advanced Ground you have: spellcasters that are bad at spellcasting, a diablo looking dude that throws fireballs that are bad in low numbers and op in mass and the stun elephant from aoe 2. 
Flyaed Dragon is just stupid so i dont talk about it,

For Celstials you have:

Anti Tank Unit long range and short range, Invisible Scout that can fly and attach itself to the trees, ( very fun to have a perma cloaked unit in your base) The droidika from Star Wars that blows up your Units after you kill it, 500 spellcasters and a Hero Unit straight from Heros of the Storm.

There is so much wrong with this Game that i do NOT reccomend anyone to play it currently. I voiced my feedback since alpha. The Honeymoon phase is over so there is no excuse now. And YES I KNOW your Technology is awesome! Stop spamming me with Snowplay. I dont care if the Gameplay is boring. 

Thats my verdict its boring and i dont reccomend playing it right now if you have Sc2 avaible.",1725788115,2024-09-08 05:35:15

Update: They have recently released a new version, update 0.4.0.  They completely rewrote the campaign, and made it even worse.  The ship you're on between missions is just added tedium.

steam,174458208,"The only thing innovative or next-generation about this game is its monetization strategy. This game may be made by former Blizzard devs, but not the good ones. This quality of game feels like its the devs behind the mess that was Warcraft III Reforged or the writers of WoW's ""morally grey"" Battle for Azeroth. 

A further note, the game has had over 35 Million in funding so far and has a ""burn rate"" of over 15 million a year, i am very skeptical that this game can survive even one year on steam, without drastically downscaling the experience.

1) During kickstarter release they used the phrase ""funded till release"" numerous times to show the security of their financial backing. It was later revealed that this phrase ""funded till release"" only meant funding till early access. This was admitted and clarified on their official subreddit. This is unacceptable, since people bought in due to that understanding.


2) Again during kickstarter they sold packages with the claim ""all the content of year zero"", with year zero being defined as the period of early access. This was later ninja edited to mean a severely reduced content, backers who bought this package didnt even get all the content present at early access launch. They later apologised for this and while they wont give out all the content for free, they will give out an additional hero for free during early access to those backers. However this still doesnt aknowledge backers who bought the more expensive packages with the impression that all content during early access would be free. Furthermore in their ""apology"" they pushed the burden onto the backers for not reading correctly. This coupled with the ninja edit and the previous incident paints a company that is more interested in scamming their fans and kickstarter supporters, than do right by those who supported them early.

Many of us supported this game because we wanted to see it succeed. A lot of us are hundreds of dollars deep into this game already. Why are there pre-day 1 microtransactions that we don't own? Was my $360 not enough? Now I need to be nickel and dimed with additional paid content on the first day of early access? Yes they gave me what was promised on Kickstarter. It still feels like a slap in the face that there is content in the game I don't own, literally before the game has even released.

The campaign is terrible. We're paying at least $5 per mission. It's almost like this is a meta commentary on people caring too much about the campaign so they purposely made it as horrible as they could. Maybe this is genius. The writing, the artstyle, this game isn't winning in any category. I have the graphics maxed out, the mouths don't move during cutscenes.

The co-op is half baked at best. I'm surprised at just how often Stormgate is falling flat on it's face when not only did these developers work on successful projects, they can just copy what they did before. You've done this already! You should know what to do!



EDIT UPDATE Monetization is terrible.
The Multiplayer is F2P, no P2W, everything is fair, no questions.
Single-player and co-op are P2P ONLY (no earnable content) with a free demo. The problem is that the prices are 2 times higher than SC2, but the quality is not.
Every co-op commander is 10$, and a pack of 3 missions for the campaign is 10$.
SC2 has ~75 missions in total and ~15 commanders that you can buy. If SG had a similar quantity of content it would cost ~400$.
You will never know how much do you need to pay to get all the content. This is created to milk players indefinitely.",1725729718,2024-09-07 13:21:58
steam,174443709,"Obviously an unfinished product, but I've really enjoyed the innovative aspects of this game, including the Celestial faction as a whole.  Despite what the nay-sayers will have you think, in practice the game differs from its inspirations like Starcraft in major ways, and it is being iterated on actively.  As it's in early access, if you only want to play a game once it is fully polished, then feel free to avoid it until 1.0.

I've played a few RTS games such as SC1&2, AOE1&2, WC3, & various C&Cs.

BroodWar is by far my favorite RTS of all time as I enjoy the slower pace of the game with multiple opportunities to have various small engagements across the map. Large army fights that reward unit placement and capturing of key map locations is interesting and fun for me. Plus the way that game has evolved over the decades is really something magical and hard to reproduce/capture. The pace of the game is a bit slower which also allows for more time to make decisions and micro your units, I feel SG is capturing some of that BW essence.

As a current LoL player, I enjoy the simple and clean art style which is easy on the eyes as well as being playful. Let's not ignore the fact that LoL is one of the most popular games out and that is partly due to the art style, but also Riot has really attacked the eyes and ears of the public on many media platforms/fronts.

It's not easy to create a new, next gen RTS from scratch and I appreciate what Frost Giant has produced so far. I understand the complaints of many people in the community, but as an early access game, I think it's pretty solid so far. Would rate it around 7/10 for now due to many quality of life issues that will surely get addressed as the game progresses.

In terms of the 3 factions, I feel the human and demon races are more fluid and compartmentalized/organized. The angel robots are a bit too cheeky for my taste. We'll see how the game evolves... Anyways, happy to be able to try this game out and I look forward to StormGate as it grows. Thank you for reading my 2 cents.

steam,174379315,"It's a damn shame about this one. Out of all the early access games I've played (examples including No Rest for The Wicked, Hades 2, Rotwood, Songs of Conquest etc...), Stormgate unfortunately fails to deliver on all fronts of its early access model.

Right away, it feels like a glorified demo with little substance and content. Now I've been following this game for a long time. I won't lie to you when I say this could've been the next Starcraft or Warcraft for RTS games. Everything seemed so promising which is why two years ago now, I purchased the $25 kickstarter bundle which included the game, an additional hero, chapter 1 of the campaign, and some cosmetics for one of the factions. I'm not a kickstarter guy too, I've only ever purchased one other game on there, that being Rollin' Rascal which also looks quite promising. Whereas Rollin' Rascal has a much smaller team in scale, mainly designing fan made sonic platformers that felt great, and you could play the demo for free along with massive multiplayer lobbies, this one didn't have many betas or opportunities to test the game further and help make insightful feedback to the devs. I believe there was only one alpha and that was quite recently (two/three months back now, I may be wrong). My point is, what we're given here should've been given a year back, maybe a year and a half back. This should've been the beta, whereas the final product should've been in the oven much much longer.

With the actual game It took me close to an hour to beat the first chapter of the campaign, in which it only had 3 missions. From that point, you now must wait for upcoming chapters, play pvp multiplayer (which the netcode currently for me at least, is slightly busted making it an unplayable and not enjoyable experience), or coop content (which is extremely limited at this point, you can't even play the first chapter of the campaign in coop as of writing this review). To add to this more, there are many issues with screen tearing, graphical loading times that make your screen look like clay, and many other bugs that really dampen the experience.

Overall, if you're looking to get into a new RTS, I would suggest holding off on this one for a while. At least give it another year or two in the oven, and come back. I have faith in this team and I believe that even with everything here, the foundation is excellent and I can see this becoming something quite big on its own. There's a lot of passion, care, and attention to detail with this game. With more polish, some reworking in systems, and time for the campaign to be fully realized, this game could become another excellent addition to the RTS genre.",1725647850,2024-09-06 14:37:30
steam,174378685,"Generally speaking - game is not bad. It's good actually. Played a co-op with my friend and we realy enjoyed it - good unit diversity, lots of upgrades ''rituals'' or faction special abilities and heroes with different skills that need to be ''level up'' only few missions in co-op (but that's early access) fairly balanced I believe
You can see that game has been inspired by Starcraft - nothing bad about it- resources on the map in a pile that you scavenge with units, certain faction having corruption, one very-high tech faction and other being humans. If you like Starcraft you'll like this one. The game is fun I did not encountered any bugs in-game only when in lobby quick reset of the game solves it though so nothing major.
Now here we go bad things - paid campaign and (almost) every hero for the co-op mission. Game is free so campaign being locked-out behind pay-wall is okay. But heroes cost for co-op is to much- once they hit 5th lvl (out of 10) they will no longer gain experience- about 10$ I believe . There are 4 that you could buy so yeah. If it were for half of that - sure. So you can have some money from people like me that are mainly interested in playing co-op.But 10$ for every hero- which are locked in with faction- is a bit much.",1725647217,2024-09-06 14:26:57

The early access feels promising at this point, but I was only able to feel that way after really sinking into the game and developing a flow for the mechanics and economy. like with all RTS, there is a learning curve, but I think it really isn't as steep as some other competitors on the market.

I recommend tossing a few hours into StormGate and letting the developers know what you feel. There is still a pretty huge amount of time until this game sees a full release and the dev's can honestly take this game anywhere.

steam,174310885,"Releasing a free to play game with an unpolished new player experience is an excercise in futility.

In Early Access you can lack some features, maps, content, but you can't have your opening cinematic hang on a black screen with a ""skip"" button, cause the first thing your player sees is that you didn't take care of this smallest of bugs.
 
Then there are some missions screens, starting a campaign, a message ""this is work in progress"" and then we have the conversation of our heroes after they landed. The scene with camera zoom on the characters, when they are talking but their mouths are not moving teleports the player to the 1990s. 
In this day and age you can do facial motion capture with a smartphone. 
So either 
- you make them talk properly with mouth movement
- you don't, but you cover their mouths
-or you don't zoom on the faces of these simple models at all

steam,174290437,"Sad to see the reviews turning on this, but it kinda makes sense.  RTS isn't a great game genre to begin with, it's more of a sport and that means high-stress and high-focus.  What made second and third gen RTS games the titans of the industry was largely the map-making tools being released with it and there's nothing like that here.  That's largely what's missing--funzie play where you're just messing around.  The vs bots isn't particularly good, and the whole game relies on competitive PvP play to be entertaining.

If you want a sport and to have a fun digital scrimmage with your friends, this game is enjoyable for an evening or a 15-minute session.  Co-op is engaging but loses some luster after a while and the hero leveling is too much of a grind to be enjoyable or motivating.

steam,174180465,"The fortnite art, bland campaign and greedy monetization have all been memed to death, so I thought I'd add something new: learning the game is a terrible experience because information are hidden.

Take the exo, a basic unit of the human faction, as an example. When you mouse over the build exo button, you can see a line that says they do ""bonus to heavy"". When you actually built one, you get to mouse over the attack tooltip when you select the exo. It tells you the range, the frequency, and base damage... but no mention of the bonus to heavy at all, much less the value of the bonus. So forget how much of a bonus it is, I don't even know if it actually does any ""bonus to heavy"", or if they just never cleaned up an old description from earlier in the development cycle.

Next, you see an upgrade for them. Something that increases their speed when hit, but no mention of how long or how much. And once you upgraded it, you can no longer see even that anywhere in the tooltip when you select exos, the upgrade building, or the build button for exo. Fortunately you can see a SFX when it triggers, so you know it exists after a fight starts. Unfortunately, it's one of the rare upgrades that has a visual indicator.

Finally, you decide to mouse over the armor. You see an armor value that's something like 10 or so. Except, it's obvious not a -10 to damage per hit because a 5 damage attack still does 5 damage to an exo, so you have no idea what it does anyway. Asking around on forums, supposedly it gives a % damage reduction, except there's no mention of that anywhere in the game, much less how much that damage reduction is.

And fun fact, the wiki has even less information than the in-game tooltips as of the time I write this review. 

Basically, if you want to know what's going on, you will have to do research. Not by playing, not by looking through tooltips, and not even by wiki crawling, you quite literally have to ask around and hope whoever answers you isn't talking out of their ass.",1725421194,2024-09-03 23:39:54

Now, let’s talk monetization. Remember when SC2 was left in the cold several years ago? Many of us were like, “Hey, I’d gladly buy those sweet Protoss skins if it meant more content and updates!” Back then, we were practically begging for Blizzard to slap price tags on cosmetics if it meant the game could stick around longer.

Fast forward to today, and here comes Stormgate, saying, “Hey, we got you! Cool skins for sale!” And suddenly, everyone’s acting like they’ve never asked for a refill on a free sample before. Humans be tripping! We wanted more SC2 content with some monetization love—now we’re getting it, and folks are out here like, “Wait, not like that!”

In conclusion, Stormgate is shaping up to be a great game that’s already giving off some serious SC2 vibes. It just needs some time, and maybe a few less humans forgetting what they asked for in the first place. Until then, keep calm, play on, and maybe buy a skin or two if you’re into that sort of thing. 😜",1725418483,2024-09-03 22:54:43
steam,174174617,"I very much enjoyed what the games Co-op mode has to offer so far. 
As a long time SC2 player with almost 100% Completion in it's Co-op (just ~50 ascension lvls to go) it is nice to finally have fresh content to play with, and I enjoy some of the differences in this game

- Gear is a nice addition to reward leveling other commanders, but it would be nice to have gear open up for unleveled commanders to make leveling a more interesting experience
- 3 players helps with uncooperative teammates and disconnects and although there are reports of poor performance I've only experanced lag issues on long games with maxed armies from all players
- Creeps make downtime between objectives rewarding and enjoyable

But I can't recommend Stormgate at this time
The game has a lot of work to go
- menu navigation, or specifically the need to reselect your chosen gamemode, and for coop the commander after every game
- ""smart"" build being dumb, Especially for rts veterans, not using workers sent before hand with move command, sending units that build HQ's back their point of origin instead of the new mine, and on one case using a single B.O.B to build 3 supply and 3 bunkers instead of pulling more just because he was idle and the base was I assume too far away
- Game difficulty being chosen near randomly when not enough people queue your difficulty, and then only showing a message for a few seconds at the start of the game, that most of the time is missed because of a little lag on start, or because I'm already multitasking 3+ things as soon as I load in to even have a chance to read it. On a related note, the vocal warning for enemy composition in Co-op is nice, but 90% I miss it because it gets lost in the whole opening dialogue of the map, and because I'm focused on tasks
- Campaigns need alot of work but hey its EA
- Versus needs reworking, with maybe whole faction reworks
- Tooltips and really the whole game in general needs to display more/accurate information
- Make a directory to view units and unit info out of matches

But the main reason I can't recommend this game is the current and future monetisation
The game is just barely in early access and already the road map shows that they are working one more ways to monetise with warchests, commanders, missions, and with the Ultimate EA bundle not even having everything it just reeks of a money first mindset that could kill the game before it even gets started.

and I can't Recommend the game top anyone but die hard Co-op Fans like me, because versus is a wash right now, and campaigns are unfinished and overpriced

For any new players, come back later, and for now go to their competition SC2, It's a much better deal at the moment, being $50CAD for 3 great campaigns, and $6.25CAD for coop commanders",1725412723,2024-09-03 21:18:43

doooo something whit the units a.i., they are too stupid even to be cannon fodder.

For a game coming from the creators of SC2, it is a horrible let down.
It plays like many different custom games from SC2 and Warcraft 3.
It would be cool for a mod on Warcraft 3, 10 years ago.


1 Hero at the start worth half an army (so dont lose it), and units to back them up. Who are almost useless without a hero. Nothing fancy, Nothing new. 
A HUGE let down from the potential that it could have been.

To top it off, It appears be laid out for the devs to make each 3 mission ""chapters"" pay to play.
Hopefully for the sake of the community they release ACTUAL campaigns. Unfortunately for the devs. I wont be sticking around to find out.  They don't get my $ for chapter 1

At least when Riot got the idea for a game from a MOD they made it F2P.

I've played all sorts of RTS games and this is the largest pile of lard in my library (not storage-wise but gameplay-wise). I will state that there is no difference between playing vs a bot and vs a try-harding player as they use the exact same strategies. Do not touch this crappy game. The PVP mode is not about developing a decent strategy by gaining more resources than your opponent and developing stronger units than your opponent but just squashing your opponent before they can even put 10 units on the battlefield.

steam,174035958,"It's Starcraft 2, but more clunky. 

Almost everything in this game is a direct rip of Starcraft. 

You have the Terran, or, Vanguard, who are blue power armor wearing humans who build engineers... I mean, bobs, to mine and build for them. Their quirk is that multiple engineers can build the same building to make it faster. They have units who can sacrifice hp to move and attack faster. They have medic units. They have units that are just a guy with a gun. 

You have the Zerg, or the Infernals, who build up charges in their main building that you can spend to create workers much more rapidly, however you have to sacrifice those workers to make your structures. Even structures to build combat units have charges you have to wait for, but build the units near instantly. And yes, there is a version of 'creep' even, called 'shroud' which you have to slowly spread across the map, and enemies can 'clear', and your units gain buffs while on shroud terrain. Want to know just how much of a copy paste this is? The Infernals have a flying transport unit that can sit still and deploy shroud... just like overlords being able to deploy and spread creep. 

And then finally you have the Protoss, or Celestials. Hyper advanced golden bois whose whole gag is how they can easily and rapidly deploy structures from their base without needing workers to actually build them. They need to build their structures within energy fields (They CAN build them outside energy fields, but it takes longer) and... get this, they can have a ton of unit building structures, all build their units at a 'prime' location so that all your units spawn from the same building regardless of distance. So yeah you can basically have your production in your main base, and deploy your units more directly to the front line. I will say this is the most unique faction, as you can have your miners independently mining without needing to being resources back to a base. But ultimately they are just Protoss. 

They are extremely on the nose with how much of a clone this game is, to the point the 'bobs' aka SUVs have a few quotes when you click on them, such as 'AHH, YOU SCARED ME' and 'IN THE REAR WITH THE... BEER'

Here's the thing... I wouldn't mind if the game was good. The fact of the matter is the game is just a worse version of Starcraft. 

Units are much larger, and they don't path very well. Units for example, have a lot of trouble encircling something to interact with it. Your builders will run around like headless chickens, not knowing where an open spot to help build a structure is. Your combat units will run around behind whiechever units are in front of them, having no idea how to get past them. In Starcraft, units will sort of push each other out of the way... that doesn't happen in this game nearly as much. 

It's very common during large engagements to just see a third of your army actually fighting, while the other two thirds sit back, unable to move forward because you already have a wall of ranged units shooting, and if you just move your army forward to get everyone shooting, now your ranged units are right in the front line and get slaughtered. 

This is especially noticeable in the co-op mode the game has. It's nice to see they are making a co-op mode, even though again, every single thing about it is a direct copy of Starcraft 2's co-op... but they made it three players instead of 2, which makes it a bit easier since one person slacking is only a third of the team, not half of it... but having three giant armies trying to run around doing objectives, it's pretty common that one army will be pushing a base, and the other two armies can't even help because they can't move past the ally that is fighting. 

Simply put, units just don't 'flow' like they do in Starcraft. They path weird, they get stuck on each other, and it's hard to get your whole army to actually engage. I remember having just 6 units attacking a building, and while 5 of them attacked just fine, the sixth just ran back and forth absolutely having no idea on how to get past the others to attack as well. 

The game isn't terrible. It's just clunky. And it feels like a mobile version of Starcraft 2. There is not a wide variety of units. For example if you build mechanical units as Vanguard, you have 3 units to choose from, a rapid fire anti air unit, a frontline AoE unit with a minigun, and a long range deployable artillery unit. And the upgrades in this game are pretty basic, often only one per unit, sometimes 2. Sometimes this is things like 'the artillery units light the ground on fire when they shoot'. Other times it's 'These units gain +2 range while they have energy'. There isn't even a generic upgrade to increase damage or armor. 

PvP also just looks boring. I've watched a lot of high level play. It seems like matches last on average, maybe... 6 minutes? Both sides rush units, and whoever has a bad fight first loses because unit production takes so incredibly long. So you'll be 5 minutes in, both sides will just have a ball of scout units, they'll fight, one side comes out on top with way more units alive, and the losing side just says gg and quits out. 

I swear I watched like 20 matches straight from one player and never saw anything but 3 unit types get built... the dog scouts, the man with spear, and the man with gun. 

I think a lot of people were hoping that this game would be Starcraft 2, but made by a developer that actually wants to continue developing and supporting the game. The problem is, it doesn't play nearly as well as Starcraft 2, and the fact they are going to actively develop it and add more content doesn't change the fact that it doesn't feel good to play.",1725247159,2024-09-01 23:19:19

Probably the biggest regretful purchase I have on this site so far. Stormgate plays....fine, and I do genuinely like the hotkeys letting you quickly train new units or upgrades, but the game lacks vision and soul everywhere else.  

Starcraft 2's units have clear design and an obvious role for what they're supposed to do in the context of their faction.  

Stormgate's factions feel more like an incoherent collection of ideas vaguely pointed in the realm of ""kind of like terran"" (Vanguard, the blue ones) ""kind of zerg-ish"" (Infernals, the demons), and ""weird protoss-like."" (The celestials, angels.)  

mixed with the uninspired sci-fi demon and angel motif, and you get a game that....while functional, doesn't really have any big twist or uniqueness that makes me want to play it.  I tried to like it for a time, but after a while, I just redownloaded SC2, and found myself greatly enjoying that game again, along with its bevy of custom content right away. 

Not to mention that even in the paid early access, there was a co op character for sale at 10 bucks. Yeah, when I saw that I immediately got a strong ""Ick"".  

I just feel like, even though the game's free now, If I wanted to ask someone to play stormgate with me, I'd point them towards SC2 instead, then we could also play custom games together.  

That's not to mention the artstyle, which just looks.....painfully generic. I genuinely struggle to remember some of the units in the factions. The barebones ""campaign"" does not fare much better, with only a few missions, and seemingly an expectation to pay for more later. 

Overall, I feel like if you're interested in this game, you'd be better off looking elsewhere. I've heard good things about Beyond All Reason, and I want to give a shout out to Godsworn, a more mythological inspired RTS that, while still in early access, shows a lot more promise and soul than stormgate does.",1725213188,2024-09-01 13:53:08

steam,173929423,"Game is extremely Under Development. Keep an eye on it, and check back in 1-2 years. If you share in their Mission Statement, maybe play patches and give feedback in their Discord and/or Reddit.

It was crowdfunded to the tune of around $2.4 million, but that probably doesn't cover much of the production costs and wages. So, they've likely taken some serious investor money, and made some serious promises to stakeholders about ROI and so on. That's mostly what I had my eye on as I played the game.

As of Late Summer 2024 -- about 2-3 years into development -- the developers seemed to be laying groundwork (net code, level editors, writing, etc.) in preparation for The Long Haul. Many people would not have this, expecting Release Candidate quality --- perhaps needing minor tweaks and updates. They advertised on an open-development style, but the gamers of the world were simply not ready to see how the sausage is made. So, people have whinged. You've probably seen a lot of that --- especially people who paid hundreds and are expected to pay more for access to content dropped post-EA. At least give 'em stuff through to the actual release, eh FGS? 

Whale-hunting aside, Frost Giant just recently redoubled efforts to update the UX, in response to some of the more recent feedback.

[h1] A... Review? [/h1]

It's kind of tough to pass judgement, knowing really anything could be changed --- trying to drill down to the Basic Experience of the game is more of an exercise in critical thinking than an actual appraisal of Stormgate, which itself is more of a vessel for hopes and expectations than a game at the moment. 

I've played the game since the Beta, and it has made some strides... just not on the immediately apparent stuff. There's a saying that 80% of the work takes 20% of the time, and that lacking 20% (ok, maybe [i] 40% [/i]) is probably what poisoned the well.

For now I'd just rate each game mode by how ""finished"" it feels. Vis a vis, if it were shown to me I'd say, ""Yeah, the core gamefeel is worked out and fun, and what's left is polish, tightening, accessibility, yadda yadda.""

[h2] THE CAMPAIGN [/h2]
It's bare-bones. I found that I enjoyed it, but it's also not breaking any molds. The first mission is a bit of an homage to WCIII's first mission, but since I didn't play WCIII it was fresh enough to me. 

FGS seemed to make minimal effort in refining the different difficulties aside from enemy damage and health. I guessed they were more interested in event handling, objective code, proof-of-concept boilerplate stuff with some set dressing. A story is developed through the missions -- it's not so terrible -- but the scenes haven't come together into a clear artistic vision yet. 

[list]
    [*] 5/10 interesting, promising, but kind of embarrassing to look at.
[/list]

[h2] COOP [/h2]
Fun for a while, gets repetitive. Has performance issues for me. I got to lvl 10 with all the heroes I had accessible. Each level may or may not provide some interesting development to a hero's play style. 

I'd like them to take more risks with this mode, but alas stability is at a premium. It's got a while to go before it stops feeling like busy work after the basics are learned.

[list]
    [*] 3/10 addictive, but grueling.
[/list]

[h2] 1v1 [/h2]
The mode with the most mechanical polish, by far. They seem to be putting their chips into competitive events for outreach. One issue with that: the game has placeholder assets, and the sounds aren't always mixed correctly. That is to say, it can be kind of painful to look at and listen to, so it kind of acts like anti-advertising.

Unit movement is a bit slow for me --- or, maybe the maps are just too large. Units take a long time to die in the early game, which I don't mind. Another gripe is that the unit pathfinding is despicable when it comes to taking a short path through gaps and when cramming through small, unit-filled gaps. Infuriating stuff.

I don't think I've really understood the 1v1 strategies enough to speak at-length. People have a lot of strong feelings about the dogs, and game balance. 

At the moment, it's been fun learning how everything fits together. I can imagine getting hardstuck at gold or whatever because I refuse to Engage with the Meta outside of the game.

[list]
    [*] 6/10? 1v1 is constantly updated. I think the unit interactions aren't changing much, but creeps and map design and T3 and so on will probably go through many iterations to make the experience interesting [i] after [/i] you've learned the basics. 
[/list]

[h2] CUSTOM GAMES [/h2]
Just kind of a basic lobby. I go here to do 2v2's with randos and to mess around with hotkeys, units, etc. Much better that the game has it than not, but truly a cosmic amount of room for improvement --- arcades, featured custom game modes, the works.

I would have really liked more space made for UGC on early-access release (as one of the ""Pillars"" in their roadmap). 

That way, players could invest their time kind of seeing what the developers see a little. That, and they could do testing on mechanics and ideas that the developers simply can't put the time into. If they're adopting a transparent, design-by-committee production, this is one of the better ways to outsource development for free, and bootstrap people who actually contribute into that production process. 

A dire outcome of this could be that, when the editor is overhauled/refactored, everyone's mods fall apart. That and network vulnerabilities might allow people to do naughty things with file transfer. 

Wishful thinking, perhaps.

[list]
    [*] 2/10 UGC BABYYYYY, looking forward to [i] that [/i] update.
[/list]

[h2] SINCE I'M ALREADY WRITING OUT MY THOUGHTS [/h2]
FGS put in some rudimentary features like BuddyBot and Auto-Hotkeys. They've added support for various nvidia graphics cards ray-tracing and DLSS. 

There's a bunch of junk I haven't mentioned because it's not ""core"" to the design and clearly unfinished. I have many complaints, but ultimately if I want this to become a good game it's only therapeutic to throw a fit in public. FFS, the game is free-to-play. If I gave a shit, and thought FGS had the capacity, I'd just submit feedback and be patient. But for how long? Their roadmap projects out to 2025, so I guess we'll give it a year and see.

And that [i] does [/i] worry me, with respect to seeing the game in a finished state. They've got to support a mid-to-large team and pay back loans, so that money has to come from somewhere. Their monetization -- basically it's $10 for coop heroes and campaign chapters,  some talk of war chests for the competitive scene --- is banking on widespread and long-term community support.

In campaign You get 3 free missions as Vanguard, 2 of those include building a base. There were no hero level ups nor unit upgrades between missions.

There is nothing going for it and at the moment it still plays like alpha  - missing animations, simple UI, simple AI, unfinished co-op. 

Only redeeming thing for me is that my 8y.o. got a grasp on it pretty quickly and he says he enjoys it - so it might be good introduction RTS for Your kid. 
But I personally can't see why bother.

EDIT: Monetization deserves 2nd thumb down by itself. Stormgate's co-op commanders cost double price of SC2, but Stormgate's co-op has around 10-15% content of SC2 right now.

The matchmaking system feels great - while right now there's a lot of new players, there's a lot of fresh competition, unlike StarCraft where you mostly get matched with 10 year veterans. So everyone is getting used to these QoL keybinds, and I must say you can get the hang of it within 20-30 games, it's easy to get better at them quickly as they're very intuitive. While the game is in Early Access right now, there's still a bunch of bugs and glitches, but most of them are rather minor. Unit Pathing issues will probably get improved, and for the moment, you can help them by queuing up commands, like a path around the obstacle. Pace of the games is perfect, most end in tier 1, but some more complex go into tier 2 and 3, and it feels satisfying to fight over objectives around the map. There are some aspects that could require less micro - I like caster units, but im unsure about banelings being on imps, at a 4 second bomb timer..

I would like to see at least 2 more units for each faction, and more drastic counterplay units (something like void rays, or brood lords), and then I feel like the choices available will be perfect.

very good game that teach us played, Story of the campaign that looks promising and coop mode quite nice.
some small problem ( this is not yet version 1.0) but potential.
Perhaps it should be:
 - change the difficulty in custom mode, too big difference between 2nd and 3rd difficulty
 - improve the flow (it is in progress, I think)
 - difference in sound level between the villain’s dialogue and the rest of the game in coop mode against the Abysse leader ( the 5 portals to destroy )

The graphics are already not bad, but they will improve in the future according to the Creator, personally it suits me like this ( as long as the fluidity is not put wrong )
but I won’t stop playing for that, the game has potential and I look forward to discovering the new updates;)

Good luck to the Creators <3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

très bon jeu qui nous apprendre a y joué, Histoire de la campagne qui a l'air prometteur et mode coop assez sympa.
quelque petit problème ( ce n'est pas encore la version 1.0) mais du potentiel.
il faudrait peut être :
 - modifier la difficulté en mode personnalisé, écart de niveau trop important entre la 2e et 3e difficulté
 - améliorer la fluidité ( c'est en cours il me semble )
 - différence de niveau sonore entre le dialogue du méchant et le reste du jeu dans le mode coop contre le chef des Abysse ( les 5 portails a détruire )

Les graphiques sont déjà pas mal, mais ils seront améliorer au futur d'après le Créateur, personnellement ça me convient comme ça ( tant que la fluidité n'est pas mise a mal )

steam,173824144,"I am updating my review after I gave the game another chance and actually enjoyed playing it.

The way units move around and the actual combat feels good, I was excited about the story and liked the overall feeling of the game - it is much improved since my first try of Stormgate in the beginning of the early access.
There has been much talk about the decisions that the developer team made (such as launch too early), which can also be seen in my previous review below, but if you look only at the game itself, it is quite enjoyable.
Of course, there is much still to polish and add, but if the game continues to be worked on, I would be excited to play it.

My old review:
The developers hyped the game up while not actually having a good product to back it up. The game has been released in too early of a state for unknown reason, while Early Access does not mean alpha or beta - the game progress stays, in-game purchases stay, and reviews stay too, it's a full-blown release of the game to the public, not an alpha or a beta version. They could have held more betas with progress resets for another year, similar to a few ones they did before. And even when games are released on Steam in so-called Early Access ""betas"", they are usually in a lot better state that this (I remember DotA 2 being absolutely massive when it released in ""beta"" or Early Access on Steam, it did not feel like an alpha version of the game at all). Here even the main menu screen and cursor are so low-quality that I want to close the game immediately. Add to that the outrageous monetisation right off the gate.

So now the game is stuck with this bad impression, a lot of bad reviews, a lot of people who won't come back after this debacle, and a company reputation tarnished (they will not be able to ever say that they release polished and quality products). Was it worth it?",1725037991,2024-08-30 13:13:11
steam,173810831,"If the devs had not built up so much hype for this game prior to early access it would probably be a strong recommend across the board given where they are in the development cycle. The baseline 1v1 gameplay is really fun to play! However, it is not (yet) fun to watch, which is a problem because most RTS fans these days mostly watch instead of play (myself included). But that's the kind of thing that comes with a full release, not early access. I love that the various factions all play very differently which promises to keep gameplay fresh and unique. 

At this stage, I recommend picking this up and only trying the 1v1. The co-op is unfinished and the campaign is very unfinished, but the 1v1 is fun to play. Again, the biggest flaw with this game to date is the ridiculously high expectations set by the marketing team for a game in this phase of development.",1725028391,2024-08-30 10:33:11

steam,173754269,"Stormgate is a free to play strategy game that has had a rough early access. It still has to deliver on many of the promises that were made, and so it is still too early for me to recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a PvE experience with friends.

Currently, the game is all about PvP. While it does feature a PvE mode for up to three players, the lack of content there will just burn you out of any enjoyment you otherwise would have had. The maps are few in number and don't last for very long.

As for the campaign, I will discuss them per mission (which consists of three scenario's)
I am happy to say that everything from the previous campaign seems to have been trashed and completely redone. Initially, I liked the direction it seemed to go into, but it didn't take me long to feel utterly disappointed again. So let's discuss the three maps.

1.
The first level is really interesting and shows great promise. It really shows what the game's designers are capable of. The writing, the way you play through it, everything seems to compliment each other. So I continued playing on to the next map.

2.
The second level feels more filler, but it does have a nice moment where your character encounters an eerie ground effect that is known as 'Shroud'. This is actually a really basic mechanic related to another faction, but I thought it was a really nice touch to see even the most basic mechanical features be grounded with a bit of lore to further flesh out the universe.
There are also a few hidden treasures for you to find in the fog of war and you have a lot of opportunities to go find them. I always like to go treasure hunting in games, so I am biased here.

3.
The third level however, is completely asinine. You have a lot to explore, yet are offered very little chance to actually go and do it. The entire level feels like a race against the clock, and I kept feeling like I wanted to do anything other than the objective (which is an escort thing you have to do throughout the entire map without pause).
You need to protect a vehicle when it is enroute to a location, defend it for a bit when it arrives, and then escort it to a new location. Do this 6 times and a hero unit from the infernal hosts shows up.
This enemy hero unit appears out of nowhere and without a cutscene to give him any personality. He just goes all murder hobo-like for 30 seconds without ever feeling like a threat, even on hard difficulty. I mean, sure, he is immune to damage, is very fast, and one shots your second base (you got this for free anyway) in a scripted event, but his damage and abilities don't match that destructive vibe. You just have to send a few units to him and after the 30 seconds, the map is done. You won, yay! Like, what was the point of this map? Why does this exist in this current state? I just can't express the dissatisfaction I felt when I read ""Victory"", even on Hard.
In all honesty, if it wasn't for the character 'Ryker' (who is just introduced as an offscreen npc because he does not have a visible model on the map despite being present lorewise) I would say that this map was just filler to pad out the campaign. This had to have been rushed.
And it really killed my interest in wanting to know more about the story. The bad guy was uninteresting, the map was very bland and I don't see how the devs can think anyone would buy more missions after they play this third [and last free] mission. Because I don't want this. I want more of the first level. The first level felt great, but if I can't see what I am buying, then for all I know, I might be buying more missions like the third one. And I don't want that.


Other things that I noticed while revisiting this game:
* There is still no ability to choose or control which PvE map you are going to play (you can't host a custom lobby to play co-op maps and you must always queue for a random map without the ability to filter out the ones you don't like.
* The dialogue like lorebits and conversations in the campaign are hard to hear when you order your units around as their order feedback sounds overlap the audio.
* You have to click in order to progress through some of the dialogue, but this felt very unsettling to do because the moment your mouse is registered as having gone down, the dialogue advances. On some mouses, this will happen before you even hear/feel your device click. This issue makes it very easy to fatfinger/misclick, thus advancing a dialogue you otherwise would have liked to follow.
* I would love to support Stormgate's development, but I do have principles. I didn't support the kickstarter, and I didn't buy into any fomo (yet) as I rarily ever buy mtx. While I do give out some points for not having any store currencies with weird conversion rates, I still consider 10,- euros for a single hero to be way too expensive. Even at half that price, at 5,- euros, I would still be very reluctant to buy them. For comparison: Wc3 had three heroes per faction, as well as some campaign only skins. What I think 10,- euros is worth: A single hero with it's own (at least) 3 missions long campaign. (Whether the missions should pick up where the last  one ended, or offer more of a side story I will leave in the middle)",1724967893,2024-08-29 17:44:53

steam,173687123,"Stormgate summed up in one word: disappointment.

In a large part self-inflicted by advertising their game with statements like ""Crafted by developers renowned for their work on StarCraft II and Warcraft III"" -- taken directly from their own store listing. Of course the community fanboys will rabidly contest that the game should not be compared to StarCraft II or Warcraft III because they never marketed the game as such. Completely ignoring the fact that the game literally plays like a rough mashup of the two. 

The creativity, or lack thereof, is astounding. The controversial day one paid microtransaction hero (can it really be micro if we're hitting double digit US dollars now? Also those who literally paid upwards of $100 need to pay up extra as well) is an evil demon named... ""Warz"" with a z. The infernal race additionally has a unique mechanic that is canonically named ""white health"". The factions are thematically reskinned Terran, Zerg and Protoss, who are now humans, demons and angels respectively. Individually, all these aspects are rather trivial and can be overlooked. But then you look at the quality of the initial offering of the campaign, and the very ""ruff"" balance of the 1v1 meta (which is unarguably the best part of the game) and put these all together, the perspective for the future of the game seems a lot less exciting than the initial hype. 

The game is free to play, and you can easily try it out yourself, so I won't go into the details of every little thing. I wasn't expecting ""StarCraft III"" and had what I thought were realistic and tempered expectations, being familiar with early access titles and the process of software development in general. If you set the BAR low enough, beyond all reasonable expectations, you might find the game enjoyable. Otherwise, there are plenty of other RTS games out there to check out instead.",1724914971,2024-08-29 03:02:51

Pretty obvious they are trying to aim for a high skill ceiling to make yet another inane esport game but it makes the game feel like you need to micro far more than usual to use your units effectively. That's great and all for high skill player but while new it makes everything feel overwhelming when I have to remember which generic looking robot unit is called what and which abilities each one has because everything NEEDS a special ability to add more micro to the game. Units simply do not stand out enough among your own army to be able to rapidly pick out who is what, let alone what enemy units are and what they can do.

Not offensively bad or anything, just not worth the time. If you like games like Starcraft, just play Starcraft. If you dont like games like Starcraft, you wont like this game so it wont matter.",1724901191,2024-08-28 23:13:11

Each beta test and patch have had large content added with very little settled for now. Even then it's already a competitive 1v1 ladder. Some of the quick card commands and buddy bot add some nice into for anyone new to the genre with a raising of the skill floor.

steam,173633278,"Edit1: I checked again (March 2025) the game and now it can connect without issues to the servers. It runs smoothly and I can play co-op as much as I want. I now recommend the game.

The coop experience is like Starcraft 2. Varied maps, enjoyable and the queue starts searching different difficulties so you don't get stuck searching for an ""easy"" game while everybody is on Brutal+. The drawback of this is that you can end up in a very difficult game that your skill cannot match, but I think thats better than not playing at all. Bonus: You can disabel that option and only search for games in your difficulty bracket.

Note: Idc about 1vs1, or multiplayer balance, so I'm not taken those into account.

Original review: I was able to make the game run on Linux in the beta, and kind of enjoyed the coop mode.

Atm, in ""early access"", I'm not able to pass ""Checking pings"" consistently, despite protonDB https://www.protondb.com/app/2012510 suggested fix.

I can't thank Frost Giant enough for automating so much of the economic micro, that was the bane for me on so many amazing IPs. Earth 2150 first did automation for upgrades/repairs/manufacturing in 1999, FINALLY this fundamental mechanic is getting touched on again. Not just as a gimmick but a mechanic we need to start using as a foundation for any level of skill player.
The models are original and unique, however one thing I would like for cinematics and unit portraits is mouth movement.
Animations are fun, I expected everything to be moving too fast and to be confused on what unit is what in a mass fight but honestly there was a lot of thought put in on how to recognize what unit. Particle effects over multiple units from an AOE ability like all RTS's add a little confusion but you can still see your guys.

Here's to hopping this retains momentum for the future.

steam,173584037,"[First Impression] I did few campaign missions to find out for further chapters you need to pay about £12 for 4 missions (which is 1 chapter). Well okay, it's F2P game they need to earn moni somehow, fair. 
Then I was looking at the coop tab, £7 for a coop champ. SC2 have champs for £4, I had to log on Battlenet to double check it. 
So okay, I can't really finish the campaign, I can't drag someone to play coop with me. Soo all I have left is pvp. But I don't want to play pvp, at least not without a better feel to the game. Welp, nothing for casual like me here. 

To the game. The story is not that bad, I actually was a little invested rather than ""oh please just skip this"". The graphics style reminds me of some game but I cannot pinpoint it, I swear I saw it somewhere before. 
The gameplay isn't buggy or clunky, it plays rather smoothly and enjoyable. Some pickups and lore pieces during the campaign missions, even side quests and ability to chose how you want to proceed with the mission. 
The characters still needs a little bit polishing (personality wise) and also the animations and such but that is still work in progress so it's okay. 
Overall the game feels a little bit copy pasted but other than that is alright for a F2P game. 

Oh also when quitting the game, hours later I realised the game still didn't close and even Stopping it through Steam wouldn't close it. I had to restart  Steam to make it stop. 

If you're casual like me that doesn't want to spend moni on the very start, or doesn't play pvp mainly I would recommend waiting till devs work on the game some more.

steam,173567477,"Without getting a lot of you to just lose your shit and disagree with everything, the game is 'almost' identical to StarCraft in the way the macro, upgrades, and micro work. The game is really good!

There seems to be more of a focus on the micro element, as they use an AOE2-style unit train/selection system from the structures, giving you more time to be mobile on the map. This is crucial because you can boost your economy and army with the different camps, like in MOBAs, around each map.

Right now, the game is going through the suck-it-and-see phase (August 2024) as people ultimately find the cheese builds and mega all-ins. Remember the Forge Fast Immortal build from Protoss back in 2012 or so? Well, each race seems to have one of these builds, along with a couple of others that are just like mass Warhound (if anyone remembers that).

The positives are that it is silky smooth, and the game feels familiar if you are an RTS player. Everything is customizable in terms of hotkeys, and in proper Blizzard fashion, the races feel totally different. There are a number of units to choose and upgrade, and most seem to have a really cool spell-casting option that can really turn a fight in your favor. One of the gripes we had with StarCraft was that it just got deathbally (especially in the 6-worker start). There seems to be utility to stop that in SG. Base and resource collection isn't as central as it is in StarCraft, but you can still play the economy game to boom in the late game. The game is really quite good when you boil it all down and compare it to the likes of the AOE series, StarCraft, StarCraft 2, Legion, ZeroSpace (although they won’t give me a key to try that), and some of the Warhammer games. It fits really well, and I actually believe it has moved the genre forward...however:

The negatives right now are that some builds are making the ladder a bit of a grind fest (Dogs, mass Gaunt, proxy cannon rush on some maps). Units, especially with pathing, are not great, and I've seen some of the most expensive units get totally mauled by the cheapest, as the game can’t figure out what to do or the units get stuck on the map itself through building or body blocking.

All in all, it’s a great game. I know people are loving to hate on it right now. Personally, I can’t stand the art style. But it seems everything made in the Unreal Engine prefers this kind of look at the moment. If that’s for a performance preference, low-poly clever texture approach, I don’t know, but I would have liked this to be a little more gritty... but then again, we had that in StarCraft, and it may have been a conscious decision to make it look more or less like a new WC3, as these are the Frost Giant devs' roots. It’s almost like this game is setting us up for a WC3 clone in the future, but they tie it all together and hit us with another epic MMORPG. Who knows, I might be dead when all this happens, as I’m getting on a bit. I digress. The game is quite good overall, a 7/10 so far, and there’s no reason it can’t keep improving. With AOE: M being re-released and ZeroSpace, we have a lot to choose from in the RTS space, and I just hope SG hangs in there and listens to the people who are actually playing it.",1724789537,2024-08-27 16:12:17

this is an other case study on how different a multimillion dollar company product is from a trust me bro spiritual successor.
its essentially ""Back 4 Blood proves Valve carried Left 4 Dead"" all over again.
no that isnt fair this is a closer aproximation as to what wc3/sc2 feels like.
i only played coop cause thats what most of my time went into in sc2 and there is the initial hype around the coop team.

Most basic things feel more clunky than it has to be. 
Heroes have no description. No, lore isnt description. I mean: What is this hero? What units? Whats the design idea behind it? What are the abilities? Nothin. 
All ui is difficult to process, the clarity isnt there. How does someone not familiar with rts navigate this?


The 3d art and character design is really really ugly.
Ive never seen so uninspired duplo ass 3d models in my life. 
Human chick is is just ew with her possessed zombie eyes ugly features; 
Human dude bubly simple shapes everywhere and looks crosseyed. A basic unit lookin ahh.
Maloc is the one i played the most and actually looks good and interesting to play.
Who the f calls a character Warz???? Does he do multiple of the war thing? cmon...
Auralanna is also just plastic as fk. Its just plain boring. Banana peels for outfit. Utility hero, with aa that splits? Can you capitalize on that? Can you capitalize on the heals? Or other utility? nah, its just a caster unit, but then ++.
Honesly these heroes have no strong gameplay fantasy to them. 
The abilities could be given to any spec unit and be better off. and the top bar abilities have no real gameplay significance cause of the difficulty. Like imagine if you had a caster unit that poisoned the enemies and that's how you'd summon the small minions that you do with warz n maloc

Just do two fractions, its fine. Introduce more later. 
Change the barks and voice lines to be less cringe. Stop quoting philosophers by demons and previous games. Like why does the two headed lip demon quote Nietzsche?
Give the Hero designs to chat gpt to be improved I'm sure it'll be better than whatever this is.

steam,173559217,"It's fucking ugly. Why does Amara look like a sour patch kid with something to prove?

I also think the gameplay is kind of dogshit but hopefully they turn that around. We've seen greater redemption arcs from EA titles.

[This is my rant about the F2P, P2W aspects of the game right now]:
Free to play, pay to win. I don't mind dropping some cash to buy into an early access game so the developers get support, but I don't like being 'forced' into it in order to enjoy the game to the fullest. There are 5 heroes. Each hero has 10 levels. Each level functions similarly to the levels you gain in Starcraft 2's Co-Op mode. Overall it upgrades that hero and makes you more dangerous. They could have picked one hero and let everyone progress to lvl 10 on that one for free, and put the others behind a partial paywall (only let you play to a certain level). Instead, they put ALL the heroes behind a partial paywall, ensuring that you HAVE to drop 12.99 (CAD) in order to have ONE hero you can progress fully on, and multiply that by 5 to get all the heroes. 

I guess that isn't a huge deal, right? 12.99, whatever. Just feels scummy to say 'Free To Play' but lock things that largely affect gameplay behind a paywall. 

And it isn't like they've given players a shortage of ways to spend money on the game already. You have to buy campaign missions too. There's a 'pet' on the store for a couple bucks as well, which is just wild to me- who wants a pet running around their base in an RTS? And all those tiered supporter bundles. I won't be surprised when they release a BATTLE PASS for this game down the line.

steam,173552630,I understand this is early access so this is why I'm giving this a thumbs up. The one thing I like to do in these type of games is v.s a.i. However the vs a.i lack a difficulty setting. Most games when you build up an entire army and launch em at the enemy base like an excited goldfish just to find out.. the a.i built 3 units and haven't expanded at all and only built a few buildings it gets kind of disappointing. There was one game I played they actually sent units at me but it seems like as they were being built they just had a rally point set to my units. They didn't amass some forces first so really it was just an annoyance. I tried a game with 2v2 a.i. An a.i as my teamate. My workers were trying to bring back resources to my teams main building and getting locked up in a pile. That alone is game breaking for me.

These devs were given plenty of feedback, they would respond by mentioning their ex-Blizzard credentials and tell us they have made intended design decisions and they are happy with them and our feedback was simply wrong. 

Now they're backtracking and talking about how they will be ""making refinements"", it's just gaslighting since they now realised their game has less than 1000 players total.

Without that experience of having followed the game, I would have had a lot more faith in them fixing this mess. As it stands, I'm gonna make the intended decision to make some refinements to my Steam library.",1724776909,2024-08-27 12:41:49

I don't have time to play a game serious enough to get into any level of ranked play, and I usually get left behind when I play with people who do.  I feel they did an incredible job leveling the playing field for all players.  The building ui is phenominal.  Every RTS should copy it.  Not needing to constantly micromanage my base is amazing.  From anywhere on the map I can press ""q"" and ""s"" and get a ""farm"" placed without having to adjust my focus away from whatever battle I'm in.  Its also nice that across each race, similar buildings have the same hotkey so I don't have to memorize specific things for whomever I'm playing today.  Q + D will always be a Tier 1 baracks type building.  

So far, my biggest complaint has been some of the game elements aren't intuitive yet such as ""spacebar"" will select all units across the map.

FrostGiant is looking for feedback right now. I dont care for the 1v1 much, the bar is too high. I hope to see the coop get more worked on, and im excited for the new spin on 3v3 they have coming. I think most new players (and old bad ones like me) will opt for these modes rather than the 1v1

The story so far, well its not much yet so dont expect much from it right now. the goal is to have 1.0 in about a year, but i hope they take their time to make a very polished game and if they need to push the 1.0 back a bit then I hope they do.

This game very much still needs work and optimizing but it feels SO good to play. The three races are very fun and unique compared to each other. The units feel responsive and interesting to use.

I played SC2 for years competitively and always wanted another RTS that was not SC1 to play and nothing is out there that just as smooth and enjoyable. Stormgate is the first RTS that feels good to play that isn't Starcraft, and yeah its made by all the old devs and it shows. People are complaining that its not Innovative enough, but why would they need to fix whats not broken? There is a Pro Starcraft 1 (26 year old game) and Starcraft 2 (14 year old game) scene, with active player bases to this day for a reason. The Blizzard formula for RTS just works, and try to think of literally ANY other RTS today that still has an active player base with an Esports scene that is not from Blizzard. This game has the most potential to bring back, or at least keep RTS alive and interesting. The quality of life improvements in this game are so good and the game is designed around wanting to bring in new players into the genre. Definitely give the game a chance.

steam,173501198,"Game has a lot of potential and is very fun. I did love WOW but I have always wanted a Warcraft 4. Story is too early to judge for me but the setting and vibe are very cool, like a version of Halo where the Covenant got to earth before we even got into space mixed with Stargate's Goa'uld and Warcraft's Burning Legion. Really love the ancient aliens approach. God speed.

Some criticism:
1) There is a lot of corny humor and I'm not much of a fan of it. Warcraft 3 had humor in it but it was either subtle/hidden, sparse, and often dark humor. The humor in Stormgate feels very heavy handed and too lighthearted for the setting, I would prefer a more measured approach. I feel like something more akin to Stargate SG-1 would work better where a character like O'Neil is often throwing out quips but they land better. I'm no comedian so can't express why it works well in Stargate vs Stormgate but just watch a few episodes and you'll see what I mean.

2) Vanguards = Humans/Terran, Celestials = Night Elfish/Protossy, Infernal = Undead/Zerg...... where are my space orcs/gigachad tanky brutes???? I like the scanvengers but I think they work better as creeps, maybe a race that rebelled against the infernal host and went there own way who is tanky instead of swarmy? I need orcs for my space marines and space knights to slaughter :(

3) nukes for vanguard

4) hoping you add shops for 3v3 like faction buildable shops, goblin merchant, goblin lab, mercenary camp, hero tavern (for potential neutral heroes?)

5) 1v1 mode with heroes and above mentioned shop

6) town portal/teleport scroll with invulnerability during channeling

7) Attack and armor upgrades, I love the idea of upgrades adding passives or spells but I also like the idea of investing into raw damage and armor.

steam,173481196,"Note this game has potential but balancing stats  really need to be worked on.

Balance is shit, roach vs roach Hots was better then exo turret and free repair. AOE static defense should be expensive not cheap. Also I made leaderboard with around 60% win rate and dip. Probably will be around mid 250 if I kept trying don't know. Anyhow read below for more why balance needs work.

More on reason balance is bad. Stop designing cheap tanky range unit that deal alot of damage, it's hard to balance, on top of dps per square inch of the map problem. Hell borne should be 2 shotting exos, but it's not.  Exo needs a redesign, same with argent (which isn't that big of a problem due to energy system and slow speed). And whose idea was it to give exo a movement speed buff that isn't base on cooldown and base on attack? This allows infinite kite and chase, beyond stupid decision. (Lets give rifleman in warcraft 3 this and watch orc winrate) I am not in favor of gaunt movement speed buff either but they are just deadmeat to kri flank without it(same scenario as marine vs banelling speed). Exo not a problem vs celestial because they have their own tanky cheap range unit that can shoot back. 

Celestial needs easy access to aoe vs inferno that's it, not in the form of cheap aoe static defense. Kri aoe too conditional. Black hole should not have 50% slow, or at least make it a scaling slow, start at 10% increase by 10% for every second channel. 

Double luminite map will cause balance issue if faction luminite dump is too good.

Can't really comment on inferno being oppressive beside the gaunt speed, till they get more units, but brutes are just meatshield in late game fight unlike the other 2 faction luminite dump, (assuming the scenario where blackhole is teched for celestial). There is one scenario where inferno oppressive, it's the fiend timing early game from a 5 creep camp, this can end game if opponent out of position.

I write it for the devs, whose tale I followed loosely and I don't know as people or as a company, yet I want to vouch for them having played a game that clearly had a lot of love and thought poured into it and that I enjoyed playing. 

I saw what happened when they gave an unfinished -yet well laboured- prototype; to an overeager, spoilt, and ignorant community; and I want to talk about it. 

Short version:
The short answer is No. No it doesn't deserve the mixed status it has at all. 

The game is fun and the devs are delivering. I enjoyed what I played, and seeing as its a free early release build that only has 2 years of work in, I got a lot more then I initially expected.

The game is clearly unfinished, but so what? It's clearly saying that to you every step of the way. 

The banner clearly says: ""early access"" right now above the download button. When it boots, a whole letter pops up saying ""this game is completely unfinished"". A similar message pops up again in the campaign (I recall), clearly saying ""game is still being made, very unfinished"".

When the game runs, at the top left you'll see a little tracker ID for your prototype build if you ever send a bug error screenshot to the devs, yet the community laments at having touched an ""unfinished"" game. Decrying the game as ""dead on launch"" well over a year before the well advertised, and agreed upon, launch date. 

Such stupidity is tragic and destructive.

Meanwhile... The game is fun. Its very fun.

The core backbone of this game is very good, and could easily become remarkable given some key support (Yes, from you). When you drop whatever expectations you may have, you'll find an early access prototype that is very fun to play and can be dangerously addictive. 

Support the game and support the devs, otherwise come back in a year or two when V1 is actually finished. There is a lot of potential here and I have hope for what the full release will be like.

I'll write the long version at a later date with an edit. For now, I'm gonna fork over the $8 for a few more campaign missions, even if its unfinished. I'll explain later why.

Pros: Pathing & unit movement is fluid. Angel faction is very unique. Not having to select a worker to build buildings is cool. Having an AI automate your macro is great for new players trying out the game.

Cons: The art design is horrendous. In large fights I have no idea what's going on. Silhouettes are a mess.

Building silhouettes and design are terrible - from glancing at a picture, there's NO way to tell what a building does by its looks.

The setting and genre is bizarre. They have the sci-fi human Vanguard faction (Terrans from Starcraft), and what's their basic unit? A guy with a sword. If you wanted guys with swords make the setting fantasy! WHY IS THIS A SCI-FI GAME? I have nothing against futuristic guys with swords (Warhammer 40k), but their basic units are ranged! The basic unit being a melee unit makes sense for the demons. Oh and the angels? I was envisaging biblical angels, flying around with medieval swords and weaponry. Nope, basic unit is a robot guy with a gun. Why didn't the sci-fi humans with mechas and robots get their basic unit be a ranged unit? Absolutely baffling.

Why are there creeps? The primary purpose of creeps is to give XP and items to heroes. Yet heroes don't level up, and there are no items. It's like they saw Warcraft 3 and MOBAs have creeps, threw them in, but then got scared that Starcraft 2 players don't like heroes? It's a baffling decision. Either copy Starcraft 2 (no heroes, no creeps), or copy Warcraft 3. Don't half-ass both.


Overall, all playing this game made me feel was that I'd rather be playing Starcraft 2 or Warcraft 3. There's no reason to play this - Starcraft 2 is better in every conceivable way (and is FREE!). Starcraft 2 campaign, coop and versus is all superior. If this came out before Starcraft 2 in 2010, this may have been good for the time, but 15 years later and it's just not good enough. Having played a huge amount of strategy games, seeing this flop is a disappointment. They had $35 million dollars, and this was the best they could do? Disappointing. This game really needed another 6 months of development before putting it in the public's hands.

I'll come back in a year to see if anything changes.",1724630452,2024-08-25 20:00:52

Getting into the character animations and such this game has lost all quality in its character design and animations i have witnessed multiple characters body stretch in ridicules ways which any character artist would look at and go that is strange.

I don't really like the hero mechanics, I prefer how heroes work in Dawn Of War 2.  The art style is a big turnoff for me, too many games try to look like a Blizzard game, but all of that is just them trying to stick with what they know.  The actual criticism I would have that merits me leaving a negative review is that the story, world building, and characters just doesn't really hit, and the gameplay probably isn't much different from what Blizzard RTS fans are used to.

Tier 3 units will hopefully help with the lack of ""spikes"". But What I truly miss to get into the 1v1 mode and enjoy the game is just a good and proper skirmish mode. Please, improve the AI and add Skirmish. It's the best way for me to learn, how to make my build orders. I was always bad at RTS, but AI Skirmish always allows for fun experience that can be scaled up. I really like it when you can also adjust the playstyle of the bots. (Turtle, Rusher, Swarmer) The AI now still doesn't have any options and it's very easy to beat 1v2 even as a really bad player. 

For pros, I actually really like how easy it is to micro and macro, that's why it is the first RTS game I actually tried the pvp in. I suck but it was kinda fun. Altought I really miss that sandbox mode where I can practice my builds and see what fits me against an AI that can beat me if I don't keep it in check. I like the different races but the icons for Vanguard and Celestial could be swapped and I would not know. I wish Vanguard main building had an option (maybe tier 2 or 3) to act as a turret as well. Meaning you can put a unit in it, for it to become a deffensive stracture. I also think, Hellborne spawning from a Conclave would make more sense and would look really cool. Being able to exclude some maps from 1v1 would also obe nice I think. I think it has some beautiful bones, now it just needs more meat and some good skin.",1724606446,2024-08-25 13:20:46

I am in early access so I have only completed a few missions and the game has already sucked me in. The story is like from Diablo, but engaging and interesting. The heroes are similar to those in Warcraft III. I am on the fourth mission and unfortunately I cannot say how the other races present themselves. But the game is worth giving it at least a chance.

steam,173320541,"A Promising New Star for RTS Lovers

If you're a fan of Starcraft, Stormgate is the game you've been waiting for. I’ve only played through the prologue so far, but I’m already completely captivated.

The game instantly draws you in with its rich world-building and stunning visuals. The developers clearly know how to craft a universe that feels alive, much like the magic Starcraft brought to us years ago. The gameplay feels familiar, yet fresh— a perfect blend of nostalgia and innovation. You can sense the love and passion that has gone into every detail, from the fluid mechanics to the engaging storyline.

What really impressed me is how accessible Stormgate is for both veterans of the genre and newcomers alike. It strikes a balance that many modern RTS games struggle to achieve, making it a joy to play whether you're looking for a deep strategic experience or just some fun with friends.

The prologue has left me eager for more, and if it’s any indication of what’s to come, Stormgate is set to be a must-have for every RTS enthusiast. If you loved Starcraft, you’re going to fall head over heels for Stormgate. This game is the real deal.

steam,173292904,"I've played the first two missions and nothing more, and there's some very clear signs of what type of game this is.

-There isn't a speck of originality in the game at all. That's fine, but there's also no innovation in gameplay or options, and there's a lot missing. 
-The first mission is literally the first mission of WoL, copy pasted. 
-The style, unit feel and vibe is a copy paste of WC3 but ""in SC2's universe"", so to speak. There's undertones of Diablo in there, as well.

Of all the unfinished aspects of this game, the sound is by far the worse. Cutscenes are insanely loud with seemingly no way to turn them down. Barrel explosions are very, very loud but gunfire is soft, quiet and weak sounding. Voice lines are either copied directly from other RTS titles (SC2, WC3, DoW, etc) or are slightly changed. 

This all feels weird to me - If this were a small indie title, it would be a love letter to the RTS genre, clearly. But as a proper RTS release by a real studio with workers who used to work on these old games, it just feels like unoriginal copy-pasting of prior work. With no meaningful change in mechanics or options from those games, I fail to see the reason to play this game over something like SC2 currently. 

Graphics are great, I've heard small complains from others about them but they seem good to me. The game performs okayish but uses a lot of my CPU to render unimpressive looking scenes. The first two levels are like level layouts from WC3, but desaturated and placed into this new setting. I personally think Stormgate should commit to the style they have and boost the colour contrast and saturation. 

Structures are hit or miss. Some of them are immediately identifiable, and others look extremely similar to one another. I can see this being an issue in multiplayer, but I haven't tried that yet. 

Unit control feels snappy and responsive, which is great. Many other RTS games fail in this regard, so that's a huge success in my opinion. Exo's feel exactly like marines, but visually seem weaker and less interesting. 

Overall, there's some very promising signs here, but there is a LOT of work left for Frost Giant to do. My wishlist of things for this game, as it currently stands, are as follows:
-Better optimisation for CPU usage: The game isn't visually impressive enough to demand the kinds of performance and hardware usage it's showing off.
-Better leaning into the visual style: It looks good but feels half-hearted. They want a serious tone but have cartoony graphics - Something that, in my opinion, did not work at all in WC3. 
-Better soundscape: The sounds are weak, boring, and don't really tell me what's happening in a fight with even simple units. 
-Much, much more control customisation: I can only change the UI scale by a small amount, changing hotkeys is a long list with ""Command line 1 column 1"" which isn't helpful, there's no option to force A-move commands to be on button press instead of click, etc etc. 

if these issues were addressed, it still wouldn't be as refined as SC2, but that's a given. However, it would be a solid RTS with a hopeful future, especially if the campaign is on the longer side with different split choices that impact outcomes.",1724559312,2024-08-25 00:15:12

The heroes for co-op costs twice the amount heroes do in SC2 co-op. The co-op here is just more of what you played in SC2 there is nothing new under the sun here.

The graphics are a point of contention and if people already don't like the art style how the hell are you going to sell skins? 3v3 allegedly is going to have heroes because... reasons? Are those heroes going to be store gated? Seems like someone should be wondering that.

steam,173269203,"The good:
- The control scheme from StarCraft 2 has been slightly improved. There is now a Macro panel that allows you to build units and buildings using the nearest worker, who will then return to mining. Good quality of life boost.
- Artistic style is easily readable and units are easily targetable on screen.
- For early access game most of the mechanics actually work and are pretty reliable.
- The three sides have a very distinct gameplay, similar to how SC2 was.
- Heroes in Co-op are done well. They are there, but not a central point like in WC3.
- Creep camps add meaningful game dynamic. They add useful perks, but won't tilt the game.
- Music is great. Probably the best part of the game. Still not StarCraft's Heaven's Devils though.

The bad:
- The units are kinda boring and uninspired. There's not a distinct characteristic that makes the units stand out and form an interesting composition. There doesn't appear to be much strategic depth to unit abilities.
- Controls and pathfinding are still a little clunky. SC2 seemed more natural.
- I'm pretty sure Celestials were just designed by generative AI. They're just a bland mess.

The ugly:
- The whole game feels very uninspired. There are some good ideas and good designs, but nothing iconic like ""nuclear launch detected"". I think devs were so concerned with staying in the safe middle lane to please everyone that they didn't take many stylistic chances. Vanguard is a very generic and simplified Terran, the Infernals are basically a combination of Undead and Orcs, and Celestials are somewhat like Protoss.
- The whole Stormgate universe feels kinda bland. The campaign story was most likely generated by ChatGPT. It is literally the recycle of every single blizzard game. You have to help survivors, dig through a wall, explore a dungeon and capture points because of some kind of dark energy. I'm sure in later levels there's going to be something with crystals. There's always something with crystals.

Conclusion:
I would still recommend this game. It's free to play so it's basically zero risk for you to try. The pacing of combat is a little slower than SC2, and the macro is also much more simplified. The co-op is pretty fun, but there's still not a whole lot available to unlock.

steam,173253741,"I played the first three missions of the campaign on Normal.

It's a Warcraft 3 and Starcraft mashup. The only thing missing is the flapping mouths of the characters when they are talking. 

The first chapter is a tutorial, but if you are familiar with Warcraft 3 or Warcraft lore in general, you have already played this type of game. It's Terrans vs the Burning Legion. You have mechs fighting demons. Big demons, little demons. Some humans are allied with the demons and you have to fight those, too. The sleep voice lines that fade into the background noise are all very reminiscent of Warcraft 3's campagins. 

Although enjoyable overall, things like the sparse tech tree and the lack of variety in units really illustrate how unfinished the game is at this stage. There are specialists that specifically target air units, for example, but I did not encounter any support units like the Science Vessel. There is a medic that can heal units, but that is the extent of unit synergy. Resource management also seems to be treated like a less than secondary priority. Even on normal, you get a ridiculous amount of resources. I was overloaded with Luminite and Therium within minutes. Scripts for AI allies in the campaign seem to be basic. The last mission has you rescuing some prisoners who join you in the fight, and to their credit, they do withdraw when their health is low. You can heal them. This arrangement works, but it just feels like an afterthought.

The game has potential. However, I would expect more ideas from a ""next-gen RTS"". It's one of those games that make you wish you had more choices between ""Thumbs up"" and ""Thumbs down"" on the rating scale. An RTS is a big undertaking, so having this much development makes me willing to give it a chance for now.",1724523365,2024-08-24 14:16:05

steam,173248815,"If I were to describe this game in a single word it would be ""Redundant"".

So much of what you see is a retread of something else someone else did better. Many of the lines for the units are lifted straight from Starcraft and perhaps more egregious is how a majority of those units (from the main faction) are yoinked right from Starcraft as well. Our main character is just Tracer. Her best bud is just Reinhart. The plot of the game is just doom, and much of the mission structure is just Warcraft. It wears its inspirations so boldly and so brazenly that I genuinely wonder if there is even anything original under all those homages, easter eggs, and references to better, more well-liked series. 

Everything this game is trying to be, someone else has done it better and this game will remind you of that fact so frequently that it quickly loses any unique flavor of its own.

Worse yet, it seems filled to the brim with predatory monetization. The demo of the game is disguised as the full game, pulling a bait and switch on unassuming customers and leaving them with only a few missions available. Cosmetics are for sale, missions are for sale, heroes are for sale, pets, etc etc. I wouldn't be surprised if they added loot boxes and a season pass in the coming weeks.

Long story short, if the content can be chopped off the game, and sold to you piecemeal it will be.

I initially added a review of the handful of missions they give you in the “demo” but to be honest they can be summed up in about a sentence each. The first mission is an incredibly boring tutorial mission without any real stakes, and not much going on. The second mission has a bit more to it, with its greater exposition and gameplay depth but you quickly realize there is almost nothing of interest between you and the last fight. The third mission is the most interesting, but that's not a high bar as until now I’ve been absolutely bored to tears. There is even enough to say about it to warrant a second sentence, what with its interesting AI and unique locale though that is about all there is to talk about.

Maybe in six to seven years when the full game goes on sale for the price of a pack of gum, I’ll pick up that full version and give it another shot but until then I’ll sink my teeth into something with more depth, like a ham sandwich, or an empty toilet paper roll.",1724520164,2024-08-24 13:22:44

The bad:
Art style - Just ugly. The only hope for this game to look half decent would be to recreate a ton of in game models. Everything looks like Overwatch Funko Pops. 
Campaign - Laughably bad in its current state
Originality - There are very few new ideas that weren't directly taken from a unit in an older RTS like SC2
Balance - Not there, but with this I have patience as SC2 did not start out immediately well balanced. Thankfully they have been frequently releasing balance patches.

The good:
1v1 - Can be fun, sometimes. Has potential to be good with refining but will always be very derivative of SC.

Gave the game 4 tries to get to the first level. I guess it can't.

1. it crashed due to anti-cheat (some memory error) when starting up
2. it crashed due to some random shit when starting up
3. it crashed after I clicked outside the game (windowless fullscreen with 2 monitors is too much, I guess)
4. it locked up while loading the first level - I presume, because it shouldn't take 10+ minutes on a regular SSD to load a game. CPU was also 0%, so no idea what's going on).

The game is also kinda slow on start up, all to show a ""Log into Steam"" screen. that feels ridiculous as the first impression to the game. Then the crashes are just a no-go either.

I'm a programmer, I 100% understand this is an EAG, but as a consumer this is some bullshit. Never had the few EAG games I bought to _crash during startup_.

I gave Frost Giant my $60 on Kickstarter in hopes they come at least close to StarCraft 2 (cause nothing really did and it's been 20 years) and Early Closed Alphas looked and felt pretty good.

But here we are on early access release with Mixed 51 % score and that pretty much sums up my feeling from the monetization used vs quality delivered.

Campaign is just bad BUT half of it is behind paywall?!

Co-op Commanders behind paywall?

Guys? [b]I gave you $60[/b], and you don't even give me access to the little content you created that has worse quality than random SC2 Arcade map?

You know, when I heard ex-Blizzard devs, I thought it might be like Petroglyph, the ex-Westwood devs (Command & Conquer fame), who have managed to release few simple but fun indie RTS games and even did a nice job with C&C: Remastered. Nothing like the Golden Era, but at least it was something.

It turns out Frost Giant is closer to the new corrupted corpo Blizzard than the adored Blizzard of old that created state-of-the-art games one after another.

Lets break it down by comparing Stormgates value to that of Starcraft 2 (SC2).
Single-player:
Stormgate: 3 bare-bones ftp missions.
SC2: Free 27 mission campaign, complete with internal mechanics.

Co-op: 
Stormgate: 1 ftp Hero/Faction, 4 paid Heroes/Factions
SC2: 3 ftp Factions, and 13 paid Factions with free trial Variants

PvP
Stormgate: 1v1, unranked and custom lobbies
SC2: Ranked and Unranked; 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, FFA, Archon, then Custom can have up to 16 player maps.

User-created content:
Stormgate: Will come eventually?
SC2: Arcade and Map editor.


If, for arguments sake, say that the visuals, UI, UX, campaign, bugs, balance, and game optimization are all fixed, the structure that the game is presenting us is still flawed and doesn't provide me a reason to recommend this game over Starcraft 2 in its current state. This game is functionally more niche than Starcraft 2, and it relies on you having played a Blizzard RTS, instead of standing on its own as a distinct and unique title.

Since these are starcraft devs I will make some references to starcraft

NEGATIVES:
- In the first mission and a few others, you get A.I. allies that spawn to help you. First of all, if its any difficulty below brutal, your allies you get on mission 1 at least shouldnt be able to be killed. Like when you first get blockade, he slams the ground and charges the group of enemies and since you cant control him, he juts sits there and dies. Making him more durable like the tank he FEELS like he should be would be a good idea. that or making the enemies feel less like theyre all tanks. Another option is you can keep the risk of them dying in the game but as soon as they are revealed, give the player control so they can control the hero so they dont just die. At least on the first mission. Also, the first mission and the introductions feel weird. Like they just appear out of nowhere and everything feels like it was just placed there and a cinematic started just to have something or a cinematic there. Like in starcraft's first mission nothing just spawned where it was or was just there. Everything has a purpose and a reason. Like the girl with the dogs in the beginning of that mission. 

-Secondly is the models and cinematics. They look clunky and a little weird. Personally I do not like the cinemtics with the clunky models. the artstyle and models to me could use some redoing and reworking but it aint bad. I like the models like the vulcan and lancers for example. But some heroes could use a remodel. Same with their animations.

-Thirdly is im not a huge fan of the notes and all the reading. starcraft did a good job with civilians and npcs doing the storytelling. Not reading transcripts. I skipped them personally. The story telling does need a lot of work. A lot.

-I dont like how bulky and tanky everything feels and is. Like in Starcraft, you can have a ton of marines and zerglings and they die and deal damage quickly and easily. With this game you press A with even the most basic of units and they hit eachother for a while before even being close to dying. Personally I prefer the more Starcraft way the units were designed than the Warcraft way. A faster paced game is a lot better than a slow paced one to me and a few others.

- A lot of sounds and models and voice acting needs to change. The voice acting for example feels like they were just told to read the lines and thats it. Like Megan Fox as Nitara in Mortal Kombat. Just bad to me. I get the clunky models and animations during the cinematics since this IS STILL EARLY ACCESS but not a fan of any of them.

- I think there needs to be a distinct difference between every difficulty. I did not really like that damage multiplier on brutal for Starcraft. Make different events, cutscenes, cinematics, different units and everything for every difficulty. Back when I made starcraft games in the editor, I made it so most units that spawn were random. Like one unit could spawn as a marine or a medic in one spot on easy to medium or hard. Or on a higher difficulty like brutal, a medic or marauder. Something so everytime you play it, even on the same difficulty or different difficulty, it feels replayable. I love doing that with my games and its the small things that matter.

- SHOW US UNITS, NOT TELL US. For example, show the player a baneling is dangerous and explodes when close in starcraft, show a group of marines fighting some zerg and show how dangerous the baneling is. Enviornmental and dyanmic storytelling is important in any game. 

- Make bosses and heroic units feel more bossy and heroic. Like gor-lok. In the second prologue mission, make a health bar appear, maybe music? Make him have different abilties since he was big and beefy and had voicelines in the previous missions and he acted like a general but he was just a unit with more health and a guy who attacks in a straight line. It would be nice and fun. I liked the straight line attack since you cant just A move him but its still nice to have abilities. Or phases like the archangel in Starcraft. Either units are too squishy or too bulky. It needs a mix. Also models like Maloc and all that needs revamping a bit.

Other than all of that, everything else people talk about alot. Like make the missions MORE UNIQUE. Most missions I can just say ""Yup this feels like that one starcraft mission"". You guys are your own team free from blizzard now, gotta get creative. Time for some PROS!

PROS: - I like the open maps during the campaign. I love having a main objective BUT being able to explore and I love missions that have a shit ton of stuff to do in them. Like with my custom games I made a main objective yes but I made the mission open world and there were about a dozen things and missions to do and cool buttons and triggers and events that didnt even play a role or impact. just made the game feel more full and alive. ""Like oh this is here"" A GOOD EXAMPLE is having a mission where you have your heroic units and medics. You find offline and beat down VULCANS. You can move your medics TO the Vulcan to take control of it but it consumes the medic. So you choose more dmg and raw power over healing. Its a good trade and makes the world feel more alive and open. Shit like that, that I used to do. 

-I like the diversity of units. I want the campaign to have units the multiplayer or co-op dont and will never have and same for co-op and multiplayer. I know thats a tall order but having unique things for each mode makes those special units and that mode feel more unqiue and special.

- I can already tell this game will have very good custom arcade maps and tools to make said maps. I love the items and how they save between missions. Gives reason to explore and all that. I LOVE the bunkers changing into different weapons depending on what and who is in it, not bad idea. 

- I love how the A.I. in the campaign attacks and tries to help you thats nice. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND bringing back Starcraft 1's mechanic of, if a structure that is required to make a unit dies, THAT UNIT CANNOT be trained by the enemy anymore. It gives more of a reward to killing certain buildings and they can always be rebuilt by the enemy. 


Give me the map editor and I can make a goooood single mission map for ya. I edited in the Starcraft editor, I plan to do the same for Stormgate.

New RTS game
F2P ladder and 1 coop commander

Cons
-Fortnite color pallet, unit models somehow worse than mobile games
-No custom keybinds
-Minimap needs work, infernal creep doesnt show on map for some reason
-unit model looks weird, ex: amara looks like a midget
-Most bland voice acting in any RTS ive played
-Coop commanders feel weak even at max level, and not unique
-Game not optimized, my game froze once from a unit ragdoll animation and dropped to 0 fps
-Unit pathing is horrendous, units often get stuck
-Buildings cant be too close to each other, ive had a air unit stuck from spawning because i build 4 starports too close to each other
-Doesnt feel like there are unit counters in this game.
-No editors yet (so no custom maps made by community), no 2v2,3v3,4v4 in ladder
-coop commanders locked behind paywall

has potential tho.

steam,173097633,"Couple of things. 

I understand this is in early access and is half baked. I but did have fun playing it.

Though not as much as some of the other RTS titles out there. I played both beta skirmish's and this, and was looking forward to the campaign. The missions hold promise, the story is derivative. 

Now, am a 40 year old guy who was part of two decent start ups and now has some time for games :) . I understand what the team is up against. The targets need you to get the product out quick and iterate as much as you can. Our first year post launch were terrible. Our partners and investors had mismatched expectations. We lost equity with our users cause the products were half baked. But once the foundations were in place, we were able to scale fast. This is normal. I think is new in the games community.

The game has a good framework  and the vets should help cut down on Dev time. The CEO did run a very lean company for a while so I do not think they are burning through cash that fast. Fact that the CEO is addressing the community and not some PR person, shows they mean well. I would ask the community to have faith in them. Look at the $20 as a bet on them to get to where the product needs to be. I know they have $75m but I do think they get it all till they hit their milestones. It's better to get funded by the community than VCs in the long run. It is much better for the community, trust me on this. 

My gripes - the art style needs to decide who it wants to appeal to and stick to it. I don't like it, it's too fortnitsh for me. Also, the race designs are boring and inconsistent. Vanguard buildings are sometimes isometric and sometimes not. Vanguard and Infernal also are pretty generic. Celestial design is not relatable. If you develop a myth and then style it around that, the player will resonate better. Else we get triangles for everything. You guys worked on RA2, do better :)",1724419249,2024-08-23 09:20:49

steam,173061396,"Maxed all co-op commanders except Warz.

I won't talk much about art and sound as its been discussed to death.

It breaks my heart to see yet another RTS making the same mistakes of so many of its kind before it. Prioritizing on sweaty 1v1 and PvP before creating a casual playerbase foundation with a good campaign and/or coop to draw players in to get invested in your universe.

Please have a story to tell. Please make players emotionally invested in something.

Longer time to kill makes it hard to feel excited. Had a blockade army attacking an enemy base on brutal and one legionnaire/hoplite didnt even die beacause blockade outhealed the dps he was taking.

Many many units like Archangels, celestial's coolest looking unit so far, hit like wet paper towels.

Marketing it with terms like ex-blizzard etc will obviously make people compare with starcraft and warcraft.

2 weeks to change 5 numbers does not look good for the pace of development at this rate. I get you guys are working on the editor and other game modes but the lack of communication regarding the side-effects of codependency on unit stats makes it hard not to be a doomer for co-op content. If I was not clear enough, please separate pvp and co-op balance early before technical debt start to accumulate up to the point where it becomes hell to separate.

Co-op heroes are not balanced against each other right now. 3v3 with heroes will lead to aggressive nerfs that will destroy the co-op experience. I don't understand why they want 3v3 to happen with co-op heroes. It's gonna ruin pvp with amara cheeses and ruin co-op with heavy handed nerfs.

With a pace like this, I wished it was released a year later after numerous internal passes art/sound/gameplay BEFORE getting grilled on balanced and content by the public.

Another thing, the WHOLE unit roster needs to be unique to justify $12 for a single commander. Not just 1 or 2. Releasing a paid hero (Warz) on release for founders who have already invested is stupid. I don't care what the kickstarter page promises. Releasing a game in EA to ""get feedback"" and then turning around to charge already paying customers for more is just stupid from a PR perspective. What were you thinking? 

The first hero for each faction NEEDS to be free to let newcomers have a feel of all factions to decide which they want to play, and then decide if they want to pay for more commanders of that faction. But no, FGS feel compelled to fulfill the kickstarter promise first before having this critical on-boarding structure in place. However, the Warz incident means both founders AND F2P feels unfulfilled.

""Early Access"" game with many PURCHASE buttons is not a good look man. I don't know what to tell you. It signals that you are more interested in money over finishing your game.

All of this could be mitigated by releasing all this a year later. Create your onboarding commanders, create your founder commanders, do internal playtest with another closed beta, do whatever balancing you want, do another art pass, repeat however many times you want BEFORE showing it to the public.

I disagree that ""getting people to play sooner to get feedback"" is always good. It is not. It means some people will see your unfinished game and leave forever. That's why closed betas exist.

If you enjoy Blizzard-style RTS games, Stormgate is gonna be a good time for you. If you like the idea of playing an RTS but feel intimidated, it's got some great innovations like the BuddyBot to help you ease in which frankly was long overdue for the genre. And co-op & campaign will teach you the ropes too. Stormgate is like Sc2 if the frustrating elements were taken out. Yes, the 3 races released so far give similar vibes to the 3 races from Starcraft (they play like unique modern twists on a lot of the old concepts in sc2, and smooth as butter to boot). I've seen so much negativity surrounding this game, which is typical of Internet doomsayers. Give it a shot yourself and ignore the echo chamber. There's a lot of fun stuff in here, especially if you enjoy RTS games, and it just keeps getting better with each patch. (For the people decrying its supposed lack of creativity - why don't I see the same comments about Zerospace, which has a terran ripoff faction, another terran ripoff faction with like six units total, and literally just green zerg?)

Not to mention that the viewing is great. The Stormgate tournament games that have already come out are genuinely awesome, and we don't even have a fully fleshed-out esports scene yet. Go watch TastelessTV's Stormgate Showdown, especially Day 2, and thank me later. Looks like the pros and the casters are having as much fun as I am.

Yeah the campaign models in cutscenes need work, but I'm glad they actually built a fun game first and are making it look prettier as they go. That's exactly what they should be doing. The art style doesn't bother me and the people saying the game looks worse than starcraft just want a game that looks exactly like starcraft. It looks quite good in-game, and it's very readable, which is important for RTS.

Buildings are wiped out in a few hits, defense is pointless, its just spam units til you win or lose.  
Also a major disappointment, they charge $9 for a chapter in the campaign... there is 3 missions for free that last 10 mins max, and for 3 more, that is gonna cost you $9, then if you want to keep going... $9 more for a few more missions... then $9 more.... and again...$9... so $36 for a unfinished campaign.

steam,173024916,"EDIT: In addition to everything below, the recent overhaul and re-release includes AI generated content, which is an automatic negative review. Do not support this company.

This isn't a new addition to the genre; It's an inferior, reforged version of an older game.

The game's focus on small-scale squad-based combat makes me struggle to describe this as a strategy game, since you spend all your time following a hero unit around in a near-MOBA format. This may be because pathing with large armies feels almost brood-war in how uncomfortable the game gets. Expect lots of traffic jams and units standing around twitching instead of moving to the front line.

The art style is atrocious. They went with a 3D animated style that makes the *good* cutscenes look like an ad for a gambling-infested mobile game. The *bad* cutscenes are low-effort uncanny valley strawman flapping their jaws up and down like an alien trying to mimic human speech. Actors interacting with each other never make proper contact, even in the fully pre-rendered videos.

The game is also filled with bugs. Trying to queue up for co-op with a friend was a confusing mess, because the client doesn't coordinate the matchmaking settings across a party automatically, so we had to coordinate it manually over voice chat. The GUI would become non-responsive if I dared to alt-tab. Text tooltips would be incorrect in some edge cases of the mission select screen. Rocks would be missing collisions. Lots of random crashes.

The campaign, where I spent most of my time, is particularly disappointing. On a technical level, it barely reaches the level of tech demo. No rebindable hotkeys, no ability to turn off the annoying unit barks, no ability to save the game, and a checkpoint system that is literally worse than nothing because it kept putting me in soft-lock positions. Any of these things individually should not require a large number of story points, so I'm deeply concerned about what the team's tech debt looks like.

Entering a campaign mission requires TWO SEPARATE LOADING SCREENS, or THREE if you restart the mission because you need one for returning to the main menu.

The worst aspect of the campaign is the ""exploration"" elements, by which I mean hunting for pebbles in every corner of the map because the devs keep putting spare bandages in the alleyway behind the Denny's. There was not a single mission that didn't involve completely breaking the flow to smear Amara's face across as many of the walls as possible while looking for bonuses. If you're lucky, you get a healing item. If not, you get two lines of flavor text that don't add any flavor to the world. There's no way to approach the bonus objectives in a casual way, because of how often this game likes to impose one-way barriers that permanently lock you out if you dare to progress the mission before scouring for secret passages.

Throughout the game, the devs seem utterly terrified to open up the maps, and there's only ONE mission currently released that I would consider a macro mission. Mostly, you follow Amara around MOBA-style, or else it's a one-base mission that feels like a tutorial. This includes the final mission released at time of writing, which feels the most like a MOBA due to how punishing it is to move larger armies around that particular map. Even in the no-build mission where you control only a single unit, it feels bad to play because Amara has the snapturn capabilities of a dump truck.

The story is a downgraded version of Arthas's story, in which the devs clearly remembered all the dramatic twists of Warcraft III, but forgot about all the build up and humanizing moments that made that story work. Amara STARTS by press-ganging an NPC who knows about the macguffin, makes a ruckus demanding that everyone respect her authori-tay, and by the time she reaches Frostmourne, it's unclear if it actually has any corrupting influence, since Amara was ready to cull stratholme before her morning coffee. (A coffee she found in the woods behind a port-a-potty.)

Why did any of this happen? Because Warcraft II did it. The campaign opens with saving kidnapped villagers because War3 did it. You clear creep camps with your hero because War3 did it. You find a magical weapon because War3 did it. Amara turns evil because Arthas did it. You hunt for consumables in the garbage because War3 had those too.

Frostgiant reforged this game, and had the audacity to give it day-one paid DLC. It's one thing to pay homage to a game you like; but it's another to be this disrespectful about it.",1724360929,2024-08-22 17:08:49

steam,172983340,"It's basically in early alpha state. There are some performance issues and the game is generally unpolished. That being said, I play on Linux so it could be that too.

If you're interested, don't let the negative reviews deter you. As somebody who has never been big on the RTS genre this is something I appreciate and I feel like I could really get into it. There is less reliance on micromanagement of buildings and more ""overall"" commands that you can execute from anywhere and it just picks one for you. You can of course still play the old fashioned way.

I think the free part of the campaign is the fine and assuming the game sticks around I will buy and play the campaign. Maybe not yet though, mostly because I have to play on low right now and I still get stuttering. I will follow the game's development and play every now and then and see how this progresses.

Regarding all the negative reviews, having played the game I view them as overly negative. I think many people here come from Starcraft 2 and to them I say what did you expect? Yes, the game with 10 years worth of updates from one of the biggest gaming companies in the world by market cap is more polished than the unfinished early access indie title still in development.",1724336722,2024-08-22 10:25:22

steam,172887548,"
At present, I cannot endorse ""Stormgate,"" particularly given the extensive marketing efforts involving the StarCraft II team. The game appears to be far from ready for public early access. For some players, this may represent their initial foray into real-time strategy (RTS), and within moments of gameplay, issues such as unit pathfinding become apparent—such as workers becoming disoriented from their command centers and mines.

In 1v1 combat scenarios, the game suffers from subpar AI pathfinding, leading to a lack of tactical micro-management and reducing matches to mere macro-oriented confrontations. Additionally, the cooperative map rotation is excessively lengthy, and there is a notable tendency for players to abandon games immediately upon commencement. Newer players often struggle to defend against high difficulty levels, which can undermine the overall experience.

Given these observations, I believe ""Stormgate"" has considerable development ahead of it. I have expressed to my peers that once fully developed, ""Stormgate"" has the potential to render ""StarCraft II"" as a mere nostalgic relic. I maintain this perspective.

steam,172881358,"I have to say, artistically this game is really dull. If I had to describe it in two words, it would be ""no taste"".

The game I feel compelled to compare this to is StarCraft: Brood War. BW is a very old game with very old graphics and yet despite this, it is a much more artistically satisfying game. From the sounds to the colour contrast, every element of this game feels less immersive and engaging than BW. This also applies for things I wouldn't even normally consider, such as the terrain. Go back and look at how great the terrain in BW is at adding to the feel for the world, and then come back to Stormgate and compare the two. This game looks ugly from a distance, and the more you zoom in the uglier it gets.

The whole concept of the game is boring. Why should I get that excited for a half-backed clone of another game? Paying homage is something you do once or twice, not with every single artistic decision. It's one thing to take a lot of inspiration from a game, but this just feels like a counterfeit version of StarCraft 2 with a few other artistic choices ""inspired"" by Warcraft. 

It seems that the main demographic that actually likes the game are 1v1 RTS bros who are looking for another strategic challenge to overcome. The rush to discover the meta is an addictive thing, and the gameplay loop of the game is solid, so if that's your jam then there's a decent chunk of hours to be invested into Stormgate that will prove worth it. Personally, if I'm looking for a competitive experience there are already plenty of other games that scratch that itch for me.

I want to put more hours into this game to give a more holistic review, but the truth is that the game falls at the first hurdle of sucking me into it's world and making me want to care. A video game is a piece of art at the end of the day, but unfortunately, I think FrostGiant treated this game like an engineering project that would look good on paper but neglected whether or not the game had any charm.",1724269692,2024-08-21 15:48:12

steam,172872088,"stormgate costs as much (if not more than) finished AAA games while looking and feeling like an unfinished AA game. if a game is in early access, it shouldn't be charging AAA prices for works-in-progress. what's worse, the prices charged for mere pieces of stormgate are somehow far higher than those of its long-established competitor: starcraft 2. imagine charging $10 for a proof-of-concept co-op commander when starcraft 2 charges $5 for a comparable mirror-sheen polished experience. 

the 1v1 matchmaking experience is of course good (as you'd expect) but even this pillar of stormgate is missing crucial elements, as the game lacks a fully functional replay viewer. there's no production tab, units lost tab, resources spent tab, or any other tab aside from a minimal bar on the bottom of the screen showing both player's current resources. what's worse, the replay tracking is terrible: moving through a game's timeline can desync the replay, making it impossible to track the moment-to-moment movements and actions taken during a climactic battle. 

i never imagined a game made by former blizzard developers would make me nostalgic for the creature comforts inherent in blizzard games.

also, the art and overall visual appearance of stormgate is simply not good enough for the asking price. compared to starcraft 2, everything is less readable, there isn't enough color or shape contrast between units of the same faction, and individual characters (especially amara) look like deformed plastic dolls. a triple-a game's characters should never invoke the uncanny valley. 

hopefully in 6 months or a year, frost giant can turn this game around. hopefully by then, they've realized that $10 for a co-op commander is idiotic.

i'll keep playing this every so often to see if frost giant can deliver the RTS i hope stormgate will become, but thus far, everything outside 1v1 matchmaking has left me disappointed.",1724263134,2024-08-21 13:58:54

There should be a proper game tutorial(not just videos) for every faction and the resources are better viewed(at least in my opinion) on the top right or left of the screen, not crammed up with the rest of stuff in the bottom of the screen. Moreover, the upgrade system is too complicated: there are some buildings with way too many upgrades that become convoluted and easy to be confused between. I would suggest adding more specialized upgrade structures with fewer upgrades each, so that it is easier to know which upgrade does what. Last but not least, there are some major balancing issues in pvp, but this is to be expected at the launch of every PVP RTS.

In this short time, I only played singleplayer, which was the only thing that loaded to me, both coop and multi didn't load, and after roughly 2 minutes the game would crash.

The singeplayer experiance for me was horrible, AI that doesen't have any difficulty, two, and not explained anywhere on game creation screen, and both act the same. Eearly attack of standard units to your starting position without even pretending to scout, very, very next gen, really. The AI wasn't even doing anything elese yet.

Campaing, I had the, I will call it displeasure to play it, on a friend's account who paid for early acces, it was very bland. The characters were just... nothing. Only faces that yap and don't do anything else. The story feels to much like a bad copy of Warcraft 3 start, and it fells like another Arthas sitiation, that can be also a Kerrigan. But I hope to be wrong and later parts will prove that it's just a feeling not the story that will happen.

The last thing, for an EA it has a lot of things in shop, expensive as heck things. This feels more like a cash grab than an actual game, I hope to be wrong, but a game with such a big shop is not a good sign.

I hope the performance will get better, for which I will try to get my other device to test, but right now, Frost Giant, I am very baffled. How devs who say they did Warcraft and Starcraft make something like this?

Ah right, factions... Humans that are very boring. Demons using a zergy things for unit making, well not really but that's the closest thing I can think of right now. And Angels?

This one just doesn't hit the mark for what they want to charge for stuff.  I would rather have seen a fleshed out game with a release price then the $10 for mission etc....  Not going to support that type of development.  If the game had felt like it handled or perform a little better maybe I could justify it to myself even in early access.  

The controls did not feel good.  Would click to move and they wouldn't move.  Then they would bunch up and the wrong ones would end up in front when I had a melee guy for the lead.  That type of pathing issue will destroy a game like this where you units end up dead even though they shouldn't be in front.  

My $5k gaming desktop sounded like it was trying to launch to the moon it was working so hard.  With these graphics and animations that should not be the case even with something not optimized for my rig.

Maybe they can salvage something from this as it does feel like they are trying to go the old school Warcrft 3 and Starcraft route.   It isn't there yet and needs a lot of work to get there.  I just couldn't keep playing when I actually noticed the price point to just play the campaign through.

For me I don't play these games to play multiplayer, I tend to stick with campaigns or single player stuff.  Doesn't feel like they are going to put much effort into that.  Feels like they want the multiplayer gamers which I am not.

steam,172783694,"One of the worst RTS games I've played in a while with some of the best potential. I Had a little bit of fun when it works but it doesn't work well very often. It's really not worth the price tag of free, the value is much lower than free. They should start paying people some of the $35 million kickstarter they received to play this game. Pay 100000 $30 to play the game and you might have a player base greater than the current 1000 and it wouldn't even cost 10% of the funding we gave them to make this heaping pile of trash. 

This game overall is not properly made. I'm running a 3050 for graphics card which isn't bad by any means, I can play SC2 on max graphics and most games on max or high with no problems. The lag once the game starts to get underway in just a 1v1 is unbearable, i hate to think what its like in a team game. Once I start to build a few units, that's it, the game freezes up. The graphics look much worse than starcraft 2 yet somehow the game runs 10x worse. Once it starts to lag it makes it difficult to control. Asides from that its not a terrible game but its definitely not that great. Hopefully it is fixed but unfortunately when I start to see these type of lag problems I know that it's probably already too late. It's most likely just terribly programmed from the ground up. As far as gameplay is concerned its mediocre maybe a bit higher than mediocre but far from a great game. An old school RTS fan might like it but I prefer more polished RTS when its a small scale competitive RTS (AOE or SC2), otherwise I find large scale games like supreme commander a lot more fun if we're not going for the incredibly polished and balanced gameplay. This game fits neither polished nor massive fun warfare.

---

Played for a few more hours, about 10 more so steam asked if I wanted to update my review and I do actually. After playing for all these hours I've come to the conclusion that the game is even worse than I thought. The pathfinding is horrible. In one game I told my guys to leave they started walking away then half of them randomly turned around and started attacking the enemy.  Another time half left and the other half walked back towards the enemy without attacked and just died while trying to walk past them.",1724224665,2024-08-21 03:17:45

steam,172775213,"For as much as this game is touted as ""old blizzard devs making a classic RTS"", the monetization strategy is very much modern corpo acti-blizzard. 10 bucks for each hero in co-op mode and 10 bucks for 3/6 missions is simply unacceptable.

On top of that the art style is terrible as well. I understand the cartoony, Overwatch style look is something that some people like, and I will admit that it can look good even though its not my personal favorite. The problem is that the models are very low res and look like cheap plastic tabletop minis, all blocky polygons and sharp edges yet somehow glossy at the same time. The audio side of things isn't much better. All the effects sound hollow and washed out. Its just very boring to look at and listen to. 

Which is a shame because the aesthetic designs (as with WoW and other Blizzard IP) are interesting. For example, the Celestials have these cybernetic synth units with varied designs, like four-armed melee units. The Infernals are fleshy monsters with occult designs. And the humans are admittedly a little boring. But aesthetic creativity means nothing if the art is rendered horribly. 

Speaking of factions, these a pretty much the same as Starcraft. The humans are basically near-future mech fighters, the Infernals are magical demon aliens like the Zerg, and the Celestials are probably the most unique in that they aren't exactly like Protoss, but still not different enough to really matter. I was hoping for something a little more creative than the ""space cowboy humans, alien swarm, and mystical space elves"" triangle that every RTS has. Its like Frost Giant didn't want to innovate at all. And I'm not just talking about each faction conceptually, but even how they function mechanically as well. 

I haven't played the campaign because I don't see the point in checking out 3 missions if I can't even play them all and I'm certainly not paying 3.33 for a 10-20 minute mission. But lots of people are reviewing them and saying they're basically the same story that Blizzard always tells, no surprise there. 

We can pretend all we like that its enough for the 1v1 gameplay to be good (which it might very well be) but the majority of players don't care about PvP. A memorable campaign like we saw with Warcraft 3 is what makes an RTS legendary and I just don't see that happening here. 

Lastly, the custom map bots are extremely trivial to defeat, so its impossible to even practice against the AI and thoroughly learn/test each faction. Co-op is likewise a total cakewalk even with one player going completely AFK. You can pretty much just a-move and win. 

The one good thing I can say about this game is that it understands why being very micro-intensive and fast like SC2 is a bad idea. Combat is slower here, not as slow and methodical as WC3 which is kind of bummer, but somewhere between. So you have some time to respond and think critically about what is happening. I really like that and its step in the right direction in terms of bringing the RTS genre back from clickfast to a thinking person's game, but its not enough to make this not feel like a bargain bin SC2.",1724219910,2024-08-21 01:58:30

Pros: 
1. several major QOL features not seen in the genre (build menu being universal, instead of builder targeted, for example)

Cons:
1. Factions are carbon copies of SC2 factions, with the exception of the celestials, which are different ENOUGH from protoss to get a pass
2. Graphically very low tier besides the exactly 2 cutscenes that have work put into them. Better cutscenes and models promised later
3. lack of information about many many aspects of the game. Without a full campaign (and most of the small bit we do have locked behind a paywall) or a tutorial, or even descrptions of what things are, the player is left to guess and hope for the best

They described the humans (Vanguard) as ""scrappy"" fighters, yet all their units are made with round, bubbly, polished and futuristic designs...

I know that it still needs a lot of polishing but the core of the game is already there and it's very strong. By the core, I mainly think about the gameplay which is the most important aspect of a game, even more for a RTS. As a big RTS fan who doesn't particularly like 1v1, I had a lot of fun discovering the Vanguard faction which is the only one I played for now. 


That faction has so many cool things going on, for example;

From the static defense structure that has a variant for EVERY BIO UNIT of the faction depending on which one is loaded (You can even put dogs in them to transform it into a sensor tower!!);

Or the supply structure that you can upgrade individually to boost nearly every stats of a building or give it armor and the ability to give a shield to a nearby structure;

Or the fact that nearly every unit has one or more special upgrades which makes it even more unique.


I only tried one game of coop so my opinion isn't fully made, but apart the fact that there only one free hero for now (You can try the other 4 for free tho, I assume it's just that you have a level limit with them) I think it's pretty fun. It's not as expended as the one from Starcraft 2 but that's just something that takes time. When Starcraft 2 coop got out, there wasn't that much content because it was a secondary project and the primary was the archon gamemode which was a flop. It's only after they realized the success of coop that it got more content.


I recommend Stormgate not because I don't care about the way they monetized it and in some way ""betrayed"" their backers, but because you can feel that the people developing the game really care about it and are putting their heart and soul into making it. I truly believe this game is only gonna get better with time, so instead of trashing Frost Giant for their release mistakes, let's support them on their way to 1.0!",1724193309,2024-08-20 18:35:09

steam,172724498,"As someone who has been a fan of RTS games since the days of Command & Conquer and Dune 2 up to Warcraft and Starcraft, I was incredibly hyped for the development of Stormgate from the moment I heard about it. The idea of a new RTS created by veterans of the genre had me sold, and I eagerly participated in the Kickstarter campaign, convinced it would deliver on its promise.

I’m more of a campaign player, but I do enjoy a good 1v1 match from time to time. Unfortunately, the campaign in Stormgate left me cold. The dialogue and story felt lackluster, and I found myself struggling to stay engaged. It didn’t pull me in, and after a few missions, I wasn’t motivated to continue. Given how central narrative has been to my enjoyment of RTS campaigns in the past, this was a major letdown.

To make matters worse, my 10-year-old, who is very much into StarCraft II, gave Stormgate a try but quickly returned to SC2 without a second thought. If it can’t hook a younger player, who’s actively playing RTS games, that’s a red flag.

I understand that the game is still in early access, and the team is likely focusing on making Stormgate a viable contender in the esports space. But honestly, they’re missing the mark. A strong story, compelling characters, and more thoughtful world-building would not only enrich the campaign but also set a foundation that could shape the game’s overall direction art included. They’re focusing on building the competitive scene, but without a solid base, it’s hard to imagine Stormgate standing out.

steam,172713439,"Post Release:

I've put around 85 hours into this game around 15-20 of that is post launch. Here are my honest thoughts after that time. 

To cut to the chase this game is still lightyears behind StarCraft 2. But realistically that's ok for now there are plans for more campaigns and a lot can change by the time those are released assuming the developers don't run out of money to keep cooking. 

Campaign:
The story isn't anything special, with campy dialogue, mediocre voice acting, bad jokes that sometimes come off cringy. Honestly this reminds me a lot of the games I played as a kid and early teenage years, and honestly in a good way the game isn't perfect and I'm ok with that. I enjoyed the variety of campaign missions there were some really unique level ideas. My favorite was probably the level with radiation that you had to escort your troops with suppression drones. It was a really fresh and new (at least to me) idea. I believe I saw somewhere that the campaign by itself is around a $25USD purchase for that I think it was worth it. 

CO-OP:
While this was updated a bit over the time I initially reviewed and the campaign/1v1 release it hasn't changed substantially. At $10 a hero (double the heroes on SC2 cost) I don't recommend investing into it unless you really want to support the devs. The mode still has potential but it's obvious the developers aren't focused on it. So it remains in a playable and rough state.

1v1:
I don't play this much so I'll be brief. This is a great way to mess around with the other races. The bot difficulty is challenging and do-able on brutal difficulty. That's about all I've done with it. This is easily the most polished mode so if the 1v1 is your jam you should be set.


The bad turned awful
Its an absolute slap in the face for them to nickle and dime the ultimate supporters with two of the heroes being additional cost from day one leaves a sour taste in the mouth.

Final thoughts:
I don't think the game fully deserves all the hate it's getting making a good RTS is crazy hard and I think people tend to forget that StarCraft 2 in its current state came from 3 separate game releases and added co-op after the fact. I think this game is still worth supporting overall though less enthusiastically than before because of the slap in the face of the paid for heroes for ultimate backers. 


Early Access REVIEW
If you want to support the game but don't want to commit to the price of the ultimate edition go for the free to play side and buy some of the co-op heroes and wait and see if the campaign has substantial improvements.

a bit of a background on the type of RTS player I am. I've really enjoyed the stories of games like Warcraft 3 + tft, starcraft, starcraft 2, age of empires 1, 2, 4, age of mythology, rise of nations, rise of legends, many of the command and conquer titles. many of the classic greats. Most of which I play for the campaigns or for some co-op fun with friends that aren't as into the genre. I've never played any of these competitively except for friends and family as I like the games but don't have the time to dedicate to the high skill ceiling required by pretty much all of them. 

Stormgate's promise is to be the next generation of RTS. I say this to emphasize that I really want Stormgate to succeed I really wish there was a mixed option rather than recommend yes or no. as there are aspects of the game worth playing and enjoying right now. 

the good: I've played several rounds of co-op and had plenty of fun there is a broad range of difficulties to scale it to your level. while there is relatively few actual missions it's plenty for early access. And easily my favorite mode. My recommendation at this time for those interested in the game to put their money into this mode buying the hero(s) they're interested in. Unless you really want to support the devs to the max you can support both by getting the ultimate edition like I did. Just be aware there is already a hero that requires additional purchase in the shop.

The Bad: The campaign in my opinion is the worst mode the story is pretty much non-existent what is there is the barest of bones and utterly forgettable I don't feel connected to the characters at all there's not enough substance to be invested into the story in any way. On top of all that many of the missions are really short. In it's current state it really just feels like an extended tutorial. It doesn't feel like they have a writer involved. I hope they can bring this mode around but I don't have my hopes up though without a complete overhaul of what's already here and adding more missions. and extending some of the ones that are there. the only silver lining is the bar is pretty low so it shouldn't be hard for future campaign updates to improve on what's here.

The Ugly: I'm not going to mention the graphics too much as they're totally subjective you either love them, hate them, or if you're like me you're indifferent to the art style and are here for a good time. 

overall I've had a good time with this game. I won't be touching the campaign for awhile I might wait a major update or two. But I will be playing the co-op mode with friends and plan to continue to do so. I think that mode is worth supporting the devs at least as I really wish more RTS games had this style of co-op mode.",1724183101,2024-08-20 15:45:01

Factions are just the most annoying cheese of Starcraft 2 made even more annoying.
Maps are terrible, MOBA elements are superfluous and annoying.

Coop is okay but it takes way to long to level up heroes and there doesn't seem to be a way to select (or veto) maps you don't want to play. Single player is very rough at best. If thats all you care about in RTS then I would wait. the 1v1 and Coop (up to Level 5) are free but the price of single player is too high for what they offer. I really like the game and cant wait to see where it goes. (disclosure I'm a Kickstarter backer and have everything but Warz unlocked),1724175076,2024-08-20 13:31:16
steam,172688818,"Liked:
1. Gameplay is smooth, units are very responsive (similar to SC2)
2. Creep camps forces you out on the map, therefore there is less turtling and more interactions (similar to WC3)
3. You can quite easily distinguish units from one another although the color scheme on them could use a bit of work (ie; I wouldn't mind more player color on the units; on shoulder plates; helmets etc.)
4. Frost Giant Studios is very responsive to player's feedbacks and are always working on updates/ making the game better

Disliked (so far):
1. Campaign is ok, I didn't feel like the story was interesting (so far at least... still much more to come)
2. Art style is too cartoonish for my taste and I know it's too late to change that. But at least the graphics are getting better

I am not certain if they'll ultimately deliver it but I feel they are on a right track. They made a lot of corrections, and since my original reviews it both runs better and is an actual game, even if there's quite some to improve.

Primarily though the editor actually seems well-thought-out even if only terrain editing is accessible and the custom map browser allow to easily access currently played games, which tbh really hope this becomes a new RTS editor standard, it builds up on Starcraft 2 editor like it did on Warcraft 3 while seemingly trying to make some of things more accessible, which is neat considering SC2 editor got hate for some elements being ""hard to figure out"" despite offering incredible possibilities. Terrain editing so far is flexible, and there's interesting options like checking the map under different lighting which easily. Hope they deliver Data and Triggers soon.

So yeah, got some hopes for this one.",1724172569,2024-08-20 12:49:29

Greetings!  Today we’ll be looking at Stormgate an RTS that is being developed by former Blizzard employees and seems to be a spiritual successor of the StarCraft / WarCraft glory days.  I backed this game on Kickstarter and have been eagerly awaiting the Early Access having played in some of the betas.  Was the wait worth it?  Let’s discuss.

I wield Frostmorne:  At first glance take StarCraft and WarCraft and smash them together and you have something approximating Stormgate.  The visuals are passable, if not odd.  The sound design unfortunately needs a lot of work, as do the overall animations both in-game and during the cut-scenes.  But the core of the game, the RTS mechanics, are solid if not a bit too familiar.  Which unfortunately is the single thing I hold onto hope for this game, that the bones are here and solid and the rest can be refined.  The game also sports some of the best QOL (Quality of Life) elements, shift clicking orders, fast building (once you get down the hotkey menus), builders return to their previous tasks and even moving ‘select-all’ to the space bar verses other RTS.  This is the hope that I cling to on this game…

Available on Wish:  The biggest issue of this game is the lack of soul in it.  Everything feels like I’ve seen it before and not just because I’ve played almost every RTS out there but because of two specific games, Blizzard games.  This game isn’t just a spiritual successor; it feels like the offspring of those games.  Missions, design choices, even the mechanics of some of the factions are very obviously overly inspired by SC and WC.  The game feels really ‘floaty’ like every unit is slightly above the ground.  This really wouldn’t be a problem for me if the game wasn’t in the state it is.

WarStar Reforged:  I’m going to try to avoid any issues with the game that are obvious early development (the fact that single player only has 6 missions) and focus on things that I have concerns that we won’t see any dramatic changes.  As stated above the animations and sound design leave a lot to be desired as both lack any real impact to the game.  Sometimes I’ll think I have the sound off when really there just isn’t any real sound effects.  The cut-scenes also have dramatic framerate issues and lack quality animations.  You can’t pause the game, even in single player.  The story so far is okay but feels just like WarCraft 3 with sci-fi elements.  The game has crashed many times as well, but never in a game.

Side Quest Unlocked:  I wanted to touch a bit on my favorite mode, co-op.  There are a decent amount of missions so far and even the missions have multiple maps so no complaint about the amount of content.  My issue is with the commanders themselves, being that they all feel too close to their base factions.  Yes, you get some custom units and yes you get some custom upgrades and such but they feel way to close to the base factions.  Maybe I was spoiled with SC2’s huge diversity of commanders but just felt lacking.  The two vanguards play almost the same and only having 10 levels to create a unique identify seems very lacking.  My only real technical concern is that with a 3 player co-op it’ll be harder to balance and if someone leaves or goes AFK you have no recourse, can’t even take over their units.

This game is in a rough state and I’m completely unsure if this is just the polishing and refining stage or if what we have here is really the finish product with more content on the way.  It’s free to play, true but my question always is; is it worth your time?  And at this moment I must say that it is unfortunately not.  This game needs more time to develop, needs a lot of cleaning up and refinement.  With that I just can’t recommend it in good conscience.  Enjoy!

I wanted to take a moment to speak on the monetization model.  I have no issue with F2P games with purchasable content.  And an RTS that allows you to access a few commanders in co-op and the faction in skirmish mode sounds like a good model.  As a player who tends to want everything when I play a game I acknowledge that I’ll probably spend more than is actually worth it.  I do have a slight annoyance with the fact that I backed the game via KS and there is already content I need to buy.  To increase my annoyance even further there doesn’t seem to be anyway for me to buy the upgrade to the Ultimate (I have the deluxe).  Best I can see I can buy Warz from the shop but I’d rather just upgrade to the Ultimate.  It’s not a deal breaker but it does point to one of the larger reasons players are upset.",1724171471,2024-08-20 12:31:11

steam,172672937,"I am a first time RTS player, I don't have the rose tinted glasses of playing Star craft or war craft games before( I might try it after this as everyone is saying how much better those games are compared to this). So this is my first impressions on how the game is for a newbie. As I have completed the 3 available campaign mission I find the lore is interesting but the world building is not very good, In the 3 missions I didn't learn much if any about what the world is or what is the motive of any of the main characters is. It might be flushed out more in the future and I learned that there is a e-novel explaining some of the things, also there is a C.O.D.E.X that has the detailed explanations for most of the lore related things, like all the characters, time periods and what happened. My problem is it doesn't show that in game, so violates the rule of ""show don't tell"". Also one thing that irked me is that when you get some expository pieces in the middle of the campaign, it shows a window on the bottom right corner, but I can' find it any where after that, so in the heat of the game play I just clicked on that notification by mistake I have lost the lore titbits forever. If the developers can add these to the CODEX or somewhere or also make them as audio files I will be much happier. 

I also have the issues with its graphics, the options menu is fine and I has provided most of the options I'd like to see in it. Few things that are missing is the dx 12 option need to be selected from the launcher(it says its a preview, so am hoping that once it is implemented fully that option will be added to the menu) and more granular options to select the visuals. it just has one option. Also may be the developers can add the AMD equivalents of the NVidia RTX features like the upscaling and framegens. 
When I said problems with graphics I specifically mean the art style, I think they have went for the cell shaded style but it just don't land very well for me. The main character looks very odd, also the character portraits are just static images, and the lip synching doesn't exists. Characters don't move their lips which just doesn't feel right.

I am ranting only about the campaign missions and lore as I am specifically interested in that only and the frantic 1v1s or 3v3s are not really my cup of tea. I might try it to see how it is and may be I'll be get hooked on those but I don't see a possibility as I am more of a methodical player who likes take time with my games and enjoy what I am playing.

Even though I am complaining a lot about the game I like it very much, I'll be following this game for the foreseeable future and interested to know how it will be developed, All in all I believe this is a perfect entry point for the newbies like me, to get in to the RTS genre. I haven' bought the early access packs to get the access to more Campaign mission, but might buy it after re running the available missions few more times. So I am exited to dip my toes in to the RTS genre which am hoping would open up a lot more exiting adventures for me.",1724170092,2024-08-20 12:08:12

steam,172665761,"The game is a great idea, and it’s refreshing to see someone finally bring the RTS genre back to life. However, the gameplay feels extremely sloppy. Without hotkeys for grouping units, micro-managing individual units and their abilities becomes very difficult. You'll likely find yourself just rolling a giant ""ball of death"" across the map, which isn't enjoyable—especially considering the slow pace of PvP. Holding outposts and shifting around the map feels sluggish and demands too much attention and APM to be fun.

The biggest issue, however, is the pricing for the ""fairly unfinished"" campaign and the commanders in co-op. Don’t get me wrong, but charging €10 for a single hero left me somewhere between laughter and tears.

Overall, if the game receives proper design improvements and multiplayer is given its spark (I mean more options to counter your opponent's playstyle), and if Frost Giant isn’t too greedy with microtransactions—because we all saw how that went in SC2, where the community was disgusted—then this could become a shining star in the RTS genre, potentially played for the next 10 to 20 years by its dedicated community of RTS lovers.",1724168841,2024-08-20 11:47:21

steam,172657315,"Now I like this game in a base sense I think if it were more polished it would be better. But unfortunately, at the moment I cannot recommend spending money on the game. 

I understand that it is early access but currently, the campaign feels like a rip-off. If you wish to purchase the individual campaigns I believe that they are around $10 USD per 3 missions. This wouldn't be that bad In my opinion if the camping missions were fun. I've played five missions so far and they all felt slow. The sixth mission on the other hand is where I decided to write this review. I will not spoil it for anyone who wants to play it still but I am including a spoiler for those who wish to know. 

[spoiler] In the sixth mission you are supposed to capture certain objectives on the map so the enemy cannot barrage your base with electric artillery. This wouldn't be an issue if the enemy attack didn't utterly destroy your base in one or two barrages while random electric strikes are occurring on your army killing your units, the enemy is destroying your base without even being near it. and this is the SIXTH campaign mission. which you have to PAT around $10 USD for [/spoiler]

With that being said, If you like the multiplayer aspect, I would heartily recommend playing this game ESPECIALLY if you enjoy SC2 since it has similar controls with some minor differences. But if you're like me and like to experience an RTS' campaign, you will likely want to wait

This isnt to say that I think this is a bad game. I just currently believe they are charging a price for this game that does not match up to its current value. I will keep an eye on this game and likely rewrite this review as the game improves. But at the moment it needs time

Edit: Oh yeah, one more thing, I'm not hating on the main character, in fact, I like her. But please give her voice lines that make her more feel human and not feel like a completely cold robot",1724167373,2024-08-20 11:22:53

Don't try to ride the coat tails of SC and WC if you are trying to appeal to a different audience or please everyone. Select your target demographic and create accordingly - that's my advice, take it or leave it but as someone who has played SC / WC for 27 years I won't touch this game",1724159018,2024-08-20 09:03:38
steam,172616040,"At the time of this review the game is in Early Access. I can confidently say based on trying it in the early beta that it's trending in the right direction. I like the factions and they each have several cool units to hook me to get me interested. The more I play and understand the nuance of how these factions play, the more I like the game. I think this game takes a certain amount of time to understand and really appreciate. 

Things I like:
- The QWERT build & control scheme is so good, next time I go back to SC2 to play, I know it will feel dated & archaic. No more needing to hotkey your main base, your production structures, clicking on every individual structure to either do upgrades or set your rally point. It's all handed from the easy to reach & access through the QWERT system. No more telling a builder to go back & mine when they're done with building the structure. They do that automatically. It's just so smart and I appreciate the quality of life improvements. The feel of this in how it plays is easily the best part of the game. 

- Cool units and/or Unit abilities. When you're new to the game, you need a little wow factor to hook you. You cannot tell me  you can look at the Vanguard Helicarrier, Vulcan or Exo and not say ""okay that's awesome."" The same for select Infernal & Celestial units. Play as the infernals and play as a Brute which is this tier 1 lumbering melee unit. It looks great. Seems powerful but is slow. Too slow for you? Well  you can split it's body in half hatching two fiends inside it which are basically little zerglings you can run all over the map. Good for chasing down an enemy trying to retreat. That's cool. 

- Easy to see & select units. A lot has been made by the visual art-style. Some like it. Some don't. One thing that you cannot dispute. It's easy to see what units are what and who is selected. There's another popular upcoming RTS similar to C&C on the horizon. One of my biggest concerns about that game with the terrain & units is it's hard to see your units. That's just not a problem in this game.

If nothing else, this game is free to play. You're out nothing money wise if you don't like it. If you spend money on it, that's on you. Your choice. But if you want you can play this game completely for free and you're only out your time. Test it out, play some skirmishes and play  some 1v1 MP online. After at least 5 + hours in the game, I think many who do that will like it if they're big into RTS.",1724158837,2024-08-20 09:00:37

steam,172614749,"If Starcraft 2 did not exist, I would recommend this game.

I hoped Stormgate to be a better game than Starcraft 2 and expected it to be a different game than Starcraft 2, but it is simply a 1:1 copy except for the QWERT hotkeys and the topbar abilities. Nothing is different, still have your two resources mining from next to your base, supply, similar tech tree, etc... The menu and party UI is exactly the same. Loading screen the same. The only thing that now exites me for is that it is Free to Play, but the funny thing is that only the first Co-op hero is free in Stormgate.

The campaign, art direction, and sound design is lacking in quality. I think most people would agree.

Co-op is in good shape and offers a great way to try out different heroes without being pressured (too much) into spending money. The campaign, however, still needs significant improvement. It's currently lacking the polish/content compared to some other RTS campaigns.

Overall, I'm excited to see where FrostGiant takes this game in the coming months/years.",1724154430,2024-08-20 07:47:10
steam,172594223,"One of the most disappointing aspects of Stormgate is its art style. Where StarCraft II has distinct, evocative aesthetics and polished animations, Stormgate feels decidedly uninspired with choppy animations (for example the glaive towers attack animation). The art direction seems to lack a clear identity, opting for a safe, generic approach rather than something  memorable.

StarCraft II's art was iconic. The Terran, Protoss, and Zerg were instantly recognizable and carried with them a sense of history and culture, even if you had never played the original StarCraft. In contrast, Stormgate's factions and units, while functional, feel like someone created an AI-generated mix of StarCraft and Warcraft races in their design. There's a homogenity to the visual presentation of each faction (why are vanguards mechs just bigger marines?!) that makes it difficult for players to form any connection with the game's world.

Storytelling and world-building are crucial elements in RTS games, serving as the backbone for single-player campaigns and providing context for the battles that unfold. Unfortunately, Stormgate's narrative feels lackluster, and derivative. The game's story, with its own version of Arthas and a demon invasion a la WC3 feels generic and derivative (yet again).

StarCraft II's campaign had great storytelling, weaving together personal character arcs with grand-scale conflicts bundled with crazy good cinematics for its time (which made up a LOT of its casual appeal.. the old trailers were hot on YouTube). The conflicts and releationships between Jim Raynor, Kerrigan, etc added emotional weight to the narrative, making each mission feel like a vital part of a larger story. Stormgate, on the other hand, lacks this emotional resonance. The characters feel underdeveloped, making the larger plot hard to relate to.

In StarCraft II, every unit, building, and faction had a backstory that added layers to the universe. Building a battlecruiser or an ultralisk had enormous weight to it, imagining their unfathomable destructive powers that can be seen in the cinematics.

Stormgate's world feels more like a minimum-viable backdrop. Giving the bare minimum reason for all these mechanically functioning units to fight each other. But no idea of what a flayed dragon actually is.

The coop and campaign modes are just so unfinished that it’s not worth talking about them, but the lack of world building makes it hard to imagine them carrying the game on gameplay alone.",1724153466,2024-08-20 07:31:06

[h1]Stormgate Campaign, or 5 hours of expirience that should be better.[/h1]

[b]Few disclaimers[/b]
• I have some hindsight of campaign by watching day9/Grant campaign, but that was all second monitor content so majority of knowledge is by listening not by watching or analyzing their games.
• I played this game on Brutal difficulty, so I assume that this is ""hindsight"" difficulty where player know what will happen during missions. I didn't check those missions on lower level of difficulty to track are there any differences.
• This review is 90% about singleplayer gameplay experience. I have played RTS science kindergarten, and I have played English versions of starcraft 1 and age of empires at age where I have needed dictionary to translate every single word. I learn story of SC1 AFTER completing Wings of Liberty campaign and have played a lot of games
where 90% of story was cut-out by pirates. What means, I will check that campaign as it plays, not as it looks.
• Yes, I'm salty that I paid 60 dollars for this game.

My RTS Experience. I have complete those RTS games on highest difficulty:
• Starcraft (and BW) - this game is only one without chosable difficulty
• Warcraft 3 (ROC and TFT)
• Red Alert 2
• Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge
• Red Alert 3
• CnC Generals
• CnC Generals Zero Hour
• CnC 3 Tebirium Wars
• CnC 3 Kane Wrath
• Age of Empires 3
• Age of Empires 4
• Warhammer 40k Dawn of War (all addons)
• Warhammer 40k Dawn of War 2 (all addons)
• Startcraft 2 (except second mission of epilogue where I dropped difficulty to Veteran and there only mission left to 100% of SC2 campaign)

This is not full list of games I have played, like I didn't complete COH, Earth 2150, played Supreme Commander on normal, etc. This list is not to proof that I'm good player, my peak PvP is gold league Zerg, but to show that I played few games.

[h2] Campaing [/h2]

Let's touch few issues that is common for the whole campaign.

• Campaign have no mechanic of the creep camps from the 1v1. There some neutral monsters here and there but whole mechanic just removed from the singleplayer part of the game. That is especially obvious as game point to ""healing fountain"" at first mission but second fountain you can find only at mission 6 (!)

• Item description is obscure, you need to manually check stat difference for each item to compare them, and there is lots of items that are same, or just better version of another item, and some items (boots) doesn't stack, while other stack.

• Worse part of this is consumables. There like 6 types of consumables, and until you use them you don’t know what will happens, would you heal 100 HP or 250? to hero or to unit ads small splash, will you get bust or something. And those items require same slots as other items. And permanent power is in majority time is more lucrative then obscure consumables. Also, Item slots have no hotkeys. So even If I want to sacrifice +10 armor for medpack, I will not able to use it FAST.

• You can see upgrade tier 3, but you can't get tier 3 upgrades because CC tier 3 are disabled. Just remove those options too.

• I can play without Save n Load years of Paradox grand strategy teach me ""ironman"" wisdom. But why there is no ""load checkpoint"" and ""restart mission"" options in the menu?

• Campaign have no ""top menu"" abilities that make it even more boring than 1v1. Give us crazy commander abilities! Give us something spectacular!

• Amara abilities are boring (That is described in mission 5 review at reddit)

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]

https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormgate/comments/1dvx01c/why_im_so_worried_about_sg_singleplayer/

In current state Stormgate mission are far far worse than Nova missions. My issues with Nova missions were schedule and pricing. But Nova missions was fun and replable. Units and hero customization allow to replay same mission few times with different styles. Yes, some missions was not very fun but overall experience was good.

SG have like 0 replayability value and 0 customizable playstyle. 3 opening missions give no context to what faction is, it doesn't even give you half of units to try in singleplayer environment. Dear developers, you can just get customizable command panel from Legacy of the Void or at least something from Generals with in game adaptation to situation. You can steal Earth 2150 ""hub base"" to customize mission unit compositions, or AoE3 ""deck"" of support active/passive abilities, or Red Alert 2 idea of throwing all faction specific units in the one mix. Just do SOMETHING. You should make either More mission for lower price tag, or more replable value for current one.

P.S. Also don't be so greedy, make at least 1 full free sub-faction for each faction for coop. It super bad when ""3 extra heroes"" is on top of ONE SINGLE FREE HERO. WTF? When I supported game, I have expected to get at least 3 free and 3 paid. But I get 1 free 3 paid and 1 ""you can buy in shop""...",1724138455,2024-08-20 03:20:55
steam,172531419,"Coming from 1v1 Starcraft 2, I think there is still work to be done on the gameplay and graphics, but even at the current state of the game, I am enjoying playing it.",1724137730,2024-08-20 03:08:50
steam,172529905,"I'm willing to recommend Stormgate for the same reason I was interested in the game to begin with; it's an ""eff you"" to Blizzard. I grew up on Blizzard games and I was even enjoying some of their newer titles before their recent fall from grace. I deleted their launcher and havent supported them in any way for probably 4-5 years. 

Now is this game as good as SC2 or WC3? no, its not. If you are really okay with supporting blizzard and playing their games, then Stormgate has little to offer you. There are some unique elements to it, but it is largely derivative and only about equal to the sum of it's parts, whereas the classic Blizzard titles were more than the sum of their parts. 

I havent touched the campaign because it looks awful, and it sounds like the micro transactions and some of the dev's treatment towards early funders are desperate and reaching. that being said the 1v1 pvp satiates much of the thrill of playing SC2, for someone playing at a mediocre level as I am at least.

Nothing feels right about this... as it sits it's laid out like a a very bad, cartoon-ish, knock-off of SC2.  I can't imagine that this will ever even come close to even contending with SC2, which is 14 years old, and also free.  Seems they swapped around the tried and true Starcraft layout basics just to be different.  Example is putting the mini-map on the right and the control on the left, which to me feels terrible and inconvenient in-game UI, and I don't think that is just because of my Starcraft background. 

It's free, try it if you dare, but there is absolutely no reason to play this over SC2, except maybe extreme boredom or curiosity.

Campaign I've heard is ok. I'm not paying for anything until its in a much better overall shape, but as a free game, it's ok now. 

Early Access Review: Should have taken more time to work on the game before releasing for EA and yes I know that its not a full release. 1v1 is honestly the only thing worth playing at this point. 1vAI is useless and more just a faction showcase sim. Coop, while technically playable, just feels lifeless and meaningless along with the $10 per commander for some basic reskins and some +1 stat upgrades. Campaign feels like they threw it together last minute as if they forgot that was promised for launch.

 I swear the primary thing that turned me against this game was the horrific first 3 missions. As if I'm going to spend more money on that dumpster fire. They feel like they want to be both intro missions and also a fully contained story that rushes through character intros, plot points, and backstory like they think they're on their second game in the franchise. I can look past the animations, character models, and such as that can all be swapped and polished easily. But why would they create such a generic story with an extremely unlikeable main character?

steam,172483941,"Disclaimer: I want to mainly play PvE in RTS. So I can't really judge PvP and this is a review for the PvE content.

The game is alright, the price policy is plain greedy though. 
For the price for which you get all 3 SC2 campaigns and 3 comms and 3 comms for free you get 3 comms and one short campaign in SG without campaign mechanics as of yet. They want 11 bucks for three campaign missions and doubled the comm prices. Even if I ignore that SC2 has the way better package due to age there's no justification for just doubling the comm prices. And that I don't get a starter comm for every faction is more than annoying, cause it means I am forced to play Terran or pay 10$ for something that is completely free in SC2.

Everything else I can kinda forgive due to early access. The difficulty jump from normal to hard in coop is kinda nuts, the (3 free) campaign missions are a bit soso and recycle a lot of tropes (guess that's a very blizzard thing to do) and there are like 4? different coop missions right now, which means you to often get the same multiple times in a row. I don't find fights visually clear most of the time and models will nearly disappear behind other models, which is annoying when you try to heal them f.e.. But tbh RTS are rare enough that I don't expect perfection and some of this may change.

However I don't see myself invest 60$ for a short stripped down campaign without campaign mechanics and 3 comms that are fundamentally free in SC2, I just don't think that what they offer per dollar is worth recommending unless you plan to exclusively play PvP. I hope that they rethink their price policy, because I like some of what's here.",1724104901,2024-08-19 18:01:41

As someone who has played StarCraft 2 co-op from the very beginning and clocked in 12k+ games on brutal and brutal+4 to +6 (on EU and NA), this game’s co-op mode disappointed me. Not only were the co-op commanders and missions themselves underwhelming, but also the base game itself was not up to par with what I would expect from a “next-gen” RTS experience. I do not care that much about the campaign or PvP (I do not believe they can create something better than StarCraft 2 or Age of Empire 2 in these categories), so I will not go into those topics in this review. The only reason I knew about Stormgate was due to my friends in StarCraft 2 co-op talking about how Monk (Kevin Dong) said he will be dedicated to creating a great co-op experience in Stormgate.

Even though I did not agree with some of Monk’s takes with mutator balance in StarCraft 2 co-op, Monk did a really good job with StarCraft 2 co-op’s commander design; they felt extremely satisfying to play, the game mode was designed in such a way that many problems could be tackled in different ways, increasing replayability, and thus, I stuck around to play with friends and randoms for many years. 

When I saw that Monk was the Lead Co-op Designer for Stormgate, I was pretty excited to be honest since I gave him the benefit of the doubt and believed he learnt a lot from his time in StarCraft 2 co-op. If he really learnt lessons from StarCraft 2, he would have known that the most important factor in RTS is game optimization; it does not matter how great your commanders and missions are if the base game itself is littered with problems, as I will not even have the time to appreciate the work you put into the co-op design. The biggest reason that StarCraft 2 co-op was successful was that it had the solid foundation of StarCraft 2, a game with highly polished mechanics, units that have weight and significance to them, buttery smooth path-finding, and to a lesser extent, many fan favorite characters and maps to create co-op commanders and missions from.

Remember the first time you sieged Siege Tanks against units pushing into a chokepoint, used banelings against light units, or fielded Immortals against armored units? You could feel the effect they had on the situation and the fear in your opponent’s play when they realized you had these units. One of my friends in the group had this to say: “All units in Stormgate feel like wet paper bags. I attack with them and use their abilities, but I am not getting any feedback on whether they were effective or not. You would use Destruction Wave [an ability that allows Alarak to push enemy units away. This ability one-shots units with small HP pools], and the viscerality of it felt so good. You got immediate feedback. His abilities had weight to them.” Another friend made a comment while playing Stormgate: “I don’t know dude. The guys at Blizzard made a deal with the devil when they made the path-finding algorithm [for StarCraft 2] because I cannot see how else they could make it this good. It just works. Stormgate is just not like that.” When you have StarCraft 2 co-op veterans uttering such sentences about your game that is supposed to be a spiritual successor, you know you have failed.

I would like to get the “It’s Early Access though” argument out of the way. Being an Early Access title does not excuse you from poor optimization, lack of quality content, and an excessive number of things in the game being placeholders. From what I can see, the shop is fully functional, so you guys are asking players to spend money on a game that does not have a solid foundation. In Early Access, it is not “I give you guys money and hope for a good game down the line”. It is “You guys demonstrate your ability to develop a great game with the budget you already had before Early Access, and I will support you by buying things that I like in the game.” I am disappointed to say that they did not showcase this ability even though Stormgate had more than 35 million USD in funding, and they prided themselves with prior experiences like StarCraft 2 and Warcraft 3. I am sick and tired of Early Access titles doing this. This has unfortunately become quite common in the gaming industry where the motto is “get money now; fix later.” I cannot stress enough how important first impressions are. It will literally make or break your game, and they decided to release this game to the public in this state. They missed out on potential customers because of first impressions, but do they care? No, they do not. They will try making money in ways that are dishonest and disrespectful to the player; you could honestly call this game a scam, and it would not be wrong. Before trying to refute this claim, look up the definition of the word scam and understand that it does not have to be fraud in a legal sense for it to be a scam. Now, look back at the hype they generated for Stormgate when they were advertising. Finally, observe the current state of the game for what it really is, a bootleg amalgamation of StarCraft 2 and Warcraft 3. For more information about this game’s history with monetization, check out [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035144686/recommended/2012510/] this review[/url].

While I am not saying that it is impossible to turn things around (example: No Man’s Sky), the thing is, when that game came out, it was in a playable state and you could actually enjoy the game for quite a while before noticing the flaws. Here, I noticed the flaws even before starting my first co-op run. Unfortunately, StarCraft 2 runs laps around this game while it struggles to get a unit to move from point A to point B, and it is extremely depressing considering all the hype they generated about this game.

When we were playing as a group of three friends, I was playing from the EU, and my friends were playing from NA. I am not sure how the server in this game handles cross region play, but let me tell you this, they have messed up big time as I will get into later. The ping was alright at the start of the games when there were no massive armies clashing, and the path-finding algorithm did not have to put in much work.

The game’s UI was awful. It was a replica of StarCraft 2’s UI, but it felt like a bootleg version of the original that made me squint my eyes trying to find the words “Made in China”. I cannot view all the units available to a particular commander? How can such an integral part of the UI be missing? How am I supposed to know what this commander can build and deploy on the field? In StarCraft 2, before even playing the commander, you could study which units and static defense structures they got to play with even if they were locked. This is not the case here. I can just see the units that will unlock in later levels, but I cannot see my current options for that commander. This needs to be fixed immediately. I should not have to look up a guide on the internet for something as basic as the units that can be produced by a commander.

steam,172470809,"Spiritual successor? Brood War was released in December 18, 1998. I am now closer to 40 as an adult. Warcraft 4 is not coming. Starcraft 3 is not coming. Stormgate lacks creativity in world building, absent any lore, basic features that have been present in classic Blizzard games (such as the map being previewed with spawn locations during the load screen for example.) are somehow absent by launch? 

All the technical flubs could be forgiven if the game had a unique identity or strong campaign, instead the heroes are lackluster and without heart or character.  

The graphics are alright, but units lack individuality and are, frankly, knock off versions of their equivalents from Starcraft rendered with less detail.....if a game is to be labeled a spiritual successor, it should at least feel as if it has a soul. 

The work here, and I hate that this is the case, is too far from being complete and evidences a lack of creativity, polish & story development to garner the respect, time and interest of our beloved, aging community. Not to mention an absolute failure to make the game appealing to newcomers. The campaigns of all former Blizzard rts games served two core functions:

To introduce players to the factions, units, mechanics of each race &..
To world/lore build - i.e the dragoon is a fallen zealot warrior that is salvaged and built into a spider like exoskeleton…fucking awesome, this drives longevity for the game because players love knowing the backstory of a rather limited unit pool - it creates a lasting power and love for each and every unit (vs. say several irregular triangles that currently mark the backbone of aesthetics for the Cellestial Guardians). This is true even for PVP players, at least in my experience, it drives your passion for the game as a player.

Trust me, I could go on, but I think we all feel the same way. No company can rely on consumer compium, especially a startup company, and especially when people are so conditioned to disappointment.

I have no idea at this point if after such a marred launch and so many problems with the core aspects and identity (or lack thereof) of this game is salvageable, the gameplay in PVP is undoubtedly it’s strength, but still falls short in a number of ways when compared to it’s supposed “predecessor” and as a former masters player who truly loves Starcraft 2 - it almost seems disrespectful to the IP to suggest that this game is in ANY* way better than the legacy itself. I fired it up to compare, to help balance my judgment or potential bias before commenting on the state of Stormgate - and it’s night and day. Not even close. If you read this Frost Giant - we all want you to succeed…. But community voices should not have to be the ones to point out the laundry list of problems that are frankly base expectations. This threatens our trust in your competency, and in its current overall state, it threatens our trust in your vision.

Fingers crossed that they can pull out of this nose dive.

APM is still important but having to click 300 times in a split second is more on the low end and it does have some interesting ways to alleviate the clicks such as automatic buildings for workers and training. Still though the focus is on fast paced action rather than actually watching your units fight, AKA the selling point of any RTS game. Also much like with modern video games they really seem to hate anything that takes longer than 5 minutes. Aggression and expansion is still key and you'll find OG resources run out well before the mid game actually starts. Worst yet is that the only option to play this game is 1v1. There isn't even official 2v2 or more. The game is just trying to hard to be an esport which no one cares about, and since this game is *free* I can't really comment on the PvE part because they don't even throw you a bone in that area. Not that it matters, I'm sure if you scroll down you'll see more than enough posts about how awful the campaign is and overpriced heroes and map packs are and in general, how lack luster co-op is.

The best part as well: No tutorials on how to play the game. I mean yeah, there is the basic one where they teach you how to left click your mouse and wipe your butt, but nothing that actually teaches you the real game. Blizzard has always had a very interesting way in teaching players how to actually play their factions and not just the game. This game offers you a 3 minute youtube video that gives you a quick run down on some basic mechanics and then expects you to just learn on the go by doing PvP or some private skrimmsh map against passive AI.

i'm sure you've heard this complaint a billion times as well, yes the art and visuals are pretty bad. However it's less to do in the graphical sense and more to do with overall art direction. Not only are most units very bland and uninspired, but the human and angle faction feel like they dumped 30 lego sets in to a big box and ask their kids to make characters. The designs are just all over the place and make very little sense even if you don't think about it. Why do the humans have giant buster swords. a D.VA mech and Paladins? Why do the angles have wings of light, but also random mech walkers? The only faction that has any kind of thematic coherence are the deamons, which for a faction that is all about edge they sure do lack any points, looking like cutesy wootsy plush dolls of deamons you'd see at Hot Topic. In fact this game is just so bland to look at that I often don't know what I am looking at because my mind just wanders from being so uninterested. As much as I shit on SC2 and how bastardized it's art style became, it still had a lot of interesting and iconic designs. In Stormgate nothing really stands out. Even the mighty dragon thing that the deamons get is so boring and unintimidating that I've forgotten it was there.

In general, this game is another proof that money doesn't equal good entertainment. They may have raised 50 million plus dollars, but when your dev team is to afraid, lazy, or stupid to take risks you get another live service game that will be forgotten about by months end. Maybe I'll give it a few more tries, but as of now I don't feel like there is anything more to see or learn in the time I have spent.",1724084121,2024-08-19 12:15:21

Controls feel snappy and clean but without the pathfinding of SC2 where units will push each other out of the way to get where you tell them to go, so the control feels reasonably involved.

The pacing also feels really good, not SC2 warpspeed but not WC3 watching paint dry.

steam,172435848,"Alright so few things to note. Right now? it's a massive nope from me. Why? Okay, just look at the first campaign mission. A blatant steal from W3's first mission. only difference is the choice to destroy the base or to get the prisoners. Amara feels like an Arthas in the making done wrong. Then there are the other basic ass steals, like. Second mission behind the enemy base. Healing salve? Really guys? I understand you're former Blizz but you don't have to shove it in our faces. And the Adjutant steal from sc2. Man T.R.I.P.P. feels like a budget adjutant. Then there are the paid stuff. Guys you're in Early Access and content is paywalled? Great going, you're setting yourself up to failure. campaign is unplayable for me just because the blatant idea stealing, like don't get me wrong, blizzard would deserve it, and I'd support it if done right. But this ain't it chief. 
Then there are the races... Man I hate it. You have your basic Terran (we have ak-100 and CIWS in the 21st century and really? buzzsaw turrets and spear boys? whole another topic) and we have the protoss w/o shield. Who gets the shield? your basic demon race, man. I played a lot of custom w3 and sc2 maps and this game is on a custom game level. 

Another thing to note was the lack of the ""notes"" or ""logs"" menu in the game (ik that there is one in the menus) but it happened too often that either things overlap so I have to click one away or I accidentally clicked and poof. you're not reading. 

And the optimization. Man I have a ryzen 5 4500 and an RX580 Nitro+ (8gigs) and 32GB of ram and my pc wants to fly into outer space when there are more than 10 units on the screen with high graphics. You mean to tell me I can play Dirt rally 2.0 or Hogwarts Legacy on medium but not the homage to sc2? Really?

steam,172433821,"I think the problem is that, as likely as it seemed, SC2 just isn't in a position to be toppled. Their engine still holds up even 15 years later, it's already developed so you don't have to sit around and wait for things like facial animations or other fine tuning, and despite the constant gruff, SC2 is solid and already has 15 years of fine tuning (not to mention its own 7 years worth of development) to fall back on. That's not to say that there's no room for any contender, but it turns out that making a better game than SC2 is harder than it sounds and I think FG is just now finding this out :/

Maybe something entirely new would have been gladly welcomed, but this just essentially boils down to humans vs. gross aliens vs. ascended aliens, the ""marines"" even have a sort of ""stim pack"", and there's just nothing refreshing enough to justify the fact that it's basically SC2 minus 15 years of fine tuning.",1724039233,2024-08-18 23:47:13

steam,172428719,"Needs way more work, the singleplayer part of the game as-is isn't something that makes me want to spend any money : the first three missions are painfully average, and as they serve as a quick tutorial on unit control and base building (but forgetting about creep camps, an important mechanic in multiplayer), there's not much gameplay at all. The cutscenes are clearly unfinished, none of the characters have mouth/facial animations (managing to be less expressive while talking than the Protoss cast of StarCraft 2, who don't even have mouths), and missions briefing have most of the screen being used to show fluff and some kind of decorative radar while the characters portraits are being relegated to a small corner one at a time (Metal Gear Solid codex was better than this, and at least it used artwork for its characters instead of static renders of hopefully incomplete 3d models).

The scenario also manage to be unoriginal while also being weird with its timeline : a short intro flashback tries to get us into the setting, but then the first mission seems to take place way later after the Infernals victory over Earth, with what's left of humanity trying to survive. The Vanguard characters, part of some human Resistance, seem to know each other as well as Maloc, one of the Infernal leader, but none of what they lived through is shown or explained to the player, providing no opportunity to relate to any of them. And while they seem to have crossed Maloc's path in the past, there's no build up at all regarding his actions, past or present. His only trait seems to be an evil demon general who kills humans, and while he could serve as a rival and antagonist for Amara and her team, the fact that [spoiler] he is seemingly killed by Amara using her evil MacGuffin after Mission 6 [/spoiler] really makes him look like an afterthought.

As for coop, it's okay. Not having a free hero of each faction is a bit of a bummer, but the StarCraft 2-like system where you can play heroes you haven't bought with limited progression helps with the limited number of coop maps right now. Also I might be biased as I played a fair bit of Age of Mythology, but in StarCraft 2, commanders without hero units were my favorites over the hero centric ones and having new abilities on the God Power/Spear of Adun panel was a cool novelty. Right now hero units play a massive role in coop, and I hope to have a few ""hero-less"" heroes in the future if they can get this far.

However, anybody looking at the five available heroes can see which one was planned for the store (and won't be offered to people who paid for the higher Kickstarter rewards kits despite being promised all Early Access heroes). Right on the selection screen, Warz has a nice animation, coming forward slashing with his scythe before going into his idle with many effects, lights and particles. And then you have Amara, arguably the main character of the campaign, who just shuffles around with her guns before sliding awkwardly from her intro into her idle (look at her legs moving as if she was on ice, it's just bad), and that's not even talking about her weird proportions, action figure look or her LEGO hair piece being fully static.

All of this is telling me that the dev aren't focusing on anything that isn't getting them money right now (and yeah, you need to sell your game or some kind of product to get any kind of profit, but this looks more like MLM ethics and less like the Blizzard Golden Age they sell themselves as). If they truly expected people to be okay with the state of things right now to add a $10 exclusive character to their day-0 shop while selling more chapters of the currently terrible campaign for $20 which will be inevitably delayed while they work on fixing the current missions (and maybe having to redo work they thought was okay on the WIP ones), then I don't have much hope in the game getting better, yet alone the ""new generation of RTS"" it's being touted as.

(Quick word about the multiplayer as I'm not a huge fan of RTS PvP : playing a few matches and reading other people opinions about it, it seems okay. I got rushed by a few angels players and it seems to be a common occurence, but I had fun in some infernal mirrors, so it evens out.)

Pros:
- fun! massive battles, tricky spells, crazy cheeses
- just the right speed (faster than WC3, a bit slower than SC2)
- good harassment balance (you can drop, target workers with flyers, etc. - but your worker line doesn't evaporate instantly if you looked away for a second)
- innovative racial mechanics, esp for Celestials
- good matchmaking

Cons:
- the art style - just not a fan of cartoony, squeaky-clean art like in Overwatch. Gimme some rust and grime, like SC1
- the campaign - so far, a bit bland. The conflict isn't very clear or intriguing. There's an evil whispering blade (Frostmourne, you again?); dad's missing. What are the stakes and opportunities though?
- a bit rough around the edges - it's early access, after all

A diamond in the rough? The gameplay is great. Everything around it still needs some work.

The story is good so far but clearly rough around the edges and Co-Op has tons of potential going forward. We will see what the devs do into the future but some people's reactions have been way overblown and the bones here are very good. Would highly recommend, especially since it's free.

- Day 1 DLCs
- Kinda Free-To-Play, with payed missions and characters.

- few units with lots of upgrades (Star Craft devs after all)
- Sort of a ""new"" story with all of the same ad nauseam ""some dumb ass scientist opens up a portal and all the shit comes through invading the ""terrans"". Half-Life, TMNT, Mass Effect, Stranger Things, to name a few.

All in all it seems the bad lot of Blizzard rejects that ruined the decade long #1 company have started a ""quick buck grab"" project. Hoping someone will bite the hook but with lack of any real innovation in the genre nor a fresh new story.

steam,172419636,Great game for a Early Access title. Looking forward to the updates and excited to keep playing the 1v1 mode.,1724018346,2024-08-18 17:59:06
steam,172419413,"If you like playing 1v1, I think the game is already in a really fun place despite its early state. There are some balance issues to be worked out but that's to be expected for any new competitive strategy game. Frost Giant has done a great job of addressing game-breaking balance issues quickly and effectively, so while there will likely be many more changes to come, the game is a lot of fun as it is.

If you like co-op, the content that's in the game currently is pretty good but there isn't a ton of it so it might get repetitive quickly. They do plan to release a lot more co-op content in the future, but you'll have to wait a bit longer for that.

If you're only interested in playing the single player campaign then I would probably hold off for now as that is clearly the most work-in-progress experience the game has to offer and a lot of people have reacted pretty negatively to it.",1724018085,2024-08-18 17:54:45
steam,172417988,"I thought that the bad reviews were going a bit over the top, so I tried it myself (the free version)

First off, the UI is terrible. Huge buttons make it look like some sort of a mobile game
Factions look like copy paste and mishmash from factions of Warcraft 3 and Starcraft 2 (I guess thats hard to avoid, but cmon, I played Demons in skirmish, some campaign, and I felt like I'm playing a flash copycat of Warcraft 3)
No heroes in Skirmish game mode vs AI

All of that I could have stomached, I mean its an early access, and a free one at that, surely those things will go away at some point while the game is being fleshed out, no?
I'm leaving a negative review not because the game at its current state is bad (it is, but thats beside the point) I'm doing it, because I see the pay system being ported over from Starcraft 2

In its current state, the devs sell unfinished parts in an unfinished game, there is no way to buy the full game right now, or it would be crazy expensive to do so (same thing for me) seeing as they already include separately paid heroes to use in COOP (not in private server ai matches) and paid cosmetics (not cheap either) the price for the full experience may well exceed the price of the full Sims 5 game with all DLCs

In short, this looks, feels and costs like a cheap mobile game cash grab. I cannot and won't support that sort of a business model. You cant simply say that you are here to bring nostalgia, but charge like EA crap.",1724016314,2024-08-18 17:25:14

steam,172415114,what the fuck,1724013070,2024-08-18 16:31:10
steam,172415057,"Review of recent changes:
TL:DR its a step in the right direction, but still quite a few problems.
Good:
- Changed the main character to not be a tracer clone
- Graphics, models, story is better
- Mission hub is good for story telling

Bad:
- Zoom is still intensely zoomed in with no change option
- Load screens should have a moving element and not just a static image
- Some bad game design in unit introduction. First mission tosses you 3 units and your hero right from the start and don't tell you anything about their role, armor, weapon, etc. Also, the flame unit you get in this mission, you can't build for much later in the campaign. Why?
- Combat seems weightless, and kind of just ""My blob vs. enemy blob"". Attacks don't seem weighty.
- Edge-scroll speed/smoothing, however, no settings for arrow-key scrolling
- Coop level up rewards for the commanders are still pretty lack luster and some are just text-dumps

My Preferences:
- I don't like the hero item mechanics, similar to Warcraft 3. Never understood it, im playing an RTS, not a RPG
- Veterency system tends to create snowballing. Also, workers/builders have veterency which I think is kind of funny.
- So many upgrades grants units abilities. Again, it's super micro-heavy and hero heavy for an RTS. Definitely Warcraft 3 inspired, I prefer a lean more to Starcraft 2.
- Armor and Damage system is the annoying kind where you get like 200 armor, and take 10 damage. How much does that armor mean? Who knows. I prefer a 1 armor means damage reduced by 1 system.

The developers are going in a good direction and taking hard criticism, so I look forward to the future of this game. Despite my rating, I will continue to watch the game and play major updates.

--------------------
Pre-Update
There's a lot of problems:
- Hero focused to an extreme. Every commander in Coop is a hero on the battlefield, so no variation in that like Starcraft 2 coop.
- The hero perks in coop for each level 1-10 are very lack luster and just small buffs, rather than gameplay changers
- Massive emphasis on micro gameplay. So much so, they added a bot ai that will manage your base for you so you can just micro your army. Why make an RTS then, just make an rpg.
- Units feel meh, no character to them, they seem to be very similar in each army, just different skin.
- I think the developers tried to be way too safe and in the end, they made a safe, mediocre, and forgetful game. Nothing unique in the gameplay.

Small pain-points:
- Defensive structures are worthless, they melt under enemy fire and don't so that much damage.
- The units that repair structures are really slow at it.
- Camps/capture points just respawn on a timer no matter what. You could have your whole army parked on it and the 3 creatures will respawn and you will lose the point until you kill them again. Kind of ridiculous.
- In the campaign, the main character is literally Tracer from Overwatch. Duel machine guns with a blink.
- The maximum zoom out distance is too short.
- The upgrades for units are often so mediocre or useless I don't even bother getting them, better off making 2+ more units for the same cost.

I think the whole game gives me a ""meh"" feeling",1724013019,2024-08-18 16:30:19

steam,172412010,"3 major points for me, but understand this is EA so subject to change:
1) Units: There isnt great 'fantasy fulfillment' with unit / unit choices and the units seem terribly unbalanced.  Want to go all air, or all mech or riders or some sort of themed build? you 'seem' to be very punished by not just spamming the FOTM [unbalanced] unit.  
2) Skewed towards High APM players.  This is not a send your blob to fight another blob RTS.  You will lose every. single. time.  Maybe im old, maybe im unskilled, but thats what i enjoyed about BroodWar, those NR20 money maps where you see titanic blobs fight.  Since almost every unit's upgrades is a usable skill, only usable by selecting that unit type out of your blob, this GREATLY favors (maybe, even, as it should) high APM players.  And since there are no upgrades to just attack and defense, there seems little of interest in upgrading my units outside of some of the more passive ones.  
3) the other races (infernal, celestial) are absurdly locked (in co-op)  behind an additional pay-wall.  Unfuckingforgivable in an EA game to only allow 1 playable race in coop.  Honestly disgusted by FGs choice here.",1724009889,2024-08-18 15:38:09

Celestials have flying workers and can expand anywhere; this is far from protoss-like. 

I was resistant to the idea of creeps on the map, and the ""top bar"" abilities, but I feel that these add two layers of decision making that makes the strategy more deep and interesting to me. The slower combat, and longer fights means that you can abandon an engagement without forfeiting the game.

steam,172400794,"Stormgate has a great foundation. As long as the devs continue improving the game, which they have regularly done, I think this game will have a long future.

Pros:
- The engine is extremely solid. This is usually a big problem for smaller companies making RTS games. The game feels very fluid and responsive. Online games have minimal lag.
- 1v1 pvp is a lot of fun. The 3 factions are fairly well balanced considering it just went into early access. Balance tweaks are needed, but it's very playable in its current state.
- 3vE co-op works well. It's very similar to StarCraft 2 co-op, but I like having 3 players per game. The maps are limited right now, but it seems like there is a solid foundation to add more content over time.
- Personally, I've enjoyed the campaign so far. There is some placeholder art (Amara) and the story is a little derivative, but at the end of the day I've had fun during all the missions which is what matters most to me.

Cons:
- The game is clearly unfinished, which the devs have been very transparent about. Every game mode is missing key features that will be needed before they can really be great.
- After 6 campaign missions I don't really have a strong connection to any of the characters. Hopefully this is something they can work on to make the campaign story more compelling.
- Fully customizable hotkeys need to be added
- Pathing needs to be improved, especially for big Infernal units that get caught behind smaller units.",1723998922,2024-08-18 12:35:22

Stormgate is the everyman of RTS, with a bland grey filter overtop characterisations, audio, menus, factions, heros, map objectives and more. The graphics would be serviceable for 2010, but the performance isn't anywhere near what you should have for the aesthetic chosen. Path-finding is subpar, units control snappily and responsively, but there's no impact behind the feel.

The best feature would have to be the building system, sort of a blend between Command and Conquer's structure placement with traditional RTS base building workers. I'd go so far as to call this a new industry standard we should all want in any RTS game. Still there's room for improvement such as: infinite sized building queues, looping unit construction, and unit AI attitudes, all achieved decades prior to Stormgate by cult classics like Supreme Commander and Warlords Battlecry III. The unit control group tab is a good feature, but it's leagues behind how Battleforge had implemented it in 2009.

Frost Giant will have great success with their next project I'm sure, as they work through what they have and haven't yet managed with Stormgate.",1723997737,2024-08-18 12:15:37

Only two to three voice lines per unit, so you are going to listen to the same lines repeated endlessly while moving units around.

Coop Commander cost 10€ each? Even StarCraft2's 5€ was though. Now you want twice as much for a less polished version, that will probably never leave EarlyAccess?

Also why even is this an EarlyAccess game? They had a Kickstarter Campaign funding over 2.3 MILLION!
Only six months later they launch as EarlyAccess as well? Backers at the highest tier don’t even get all the content available in EarlyAccess??

I don't see how its revolutionary to now also have to keep track of idle workers on the map - the idle worker halfway across the map is prioritized over some unit mining in my base for quick build.

The tooltips are underwhelmingly vague and are quite ambiguous (let us know range and duration of a spell maybe?). Half of this junk expects you've played RTS games forever and just expects that its supposed to be fun picking up their new jank philosophy of design with the controls.

steam,172388391,"Having participated in the closed Beta, and after trying the game again for this release as somewhat of a Starcraft veteran, I can't see Stormgate succeeding in its ambitions. I'd say its main drawbacks are :
=> Terrible visual design. Everything looks uninspired, bland, fake, and often feels shamelessly plagiarized from other games (Overwatch, Starcraft II...). The three races are obviously a ""twist"" on the Terran-Zerg-Protoss from Starcraft, and lack any kind of engaging distinguishable features.
=> Terrible pathfinding (self-explanatory).
=> Terrible readability. I'd say that one of the most important features of a RTS is that you can easily tell what's going on on the screen, and that the tooltips are easy to understand. I played this game a lot during the Beta, and frankly, I still can't understand what's going on in most battles. Visual feedback must be clear and readable for players to adjust their strategies and army compositions. Additionnally, way too many things are happening between your units and the enemy's, which is due to a bloated game design (following point).
=> Bloated game design. This is the central mistake this game makes as it tries to re-invent the RTS wheel. The RTS genre is already a complicated one : lots of units, lots of strategies, lots of things to manage all at once. Therefore, what made Starcraft I and II great was the fact that the various units' stats, movement speed and attack animations were their main features, and were immediately understandable by simply playing around with the unit, or even watching it behave. Watching Zerglings spawning, running around, encircling enemies and dying to AoE damage made their use instantly obvious to everyone. General upgrades (weapon / armor) and casters with a few abilities complimented this, and most units only had one upgrade specific to them that would be a big, obvious deal when researched (Stim for Marines, for instance). Appart from that, the game could be reduced to : mine minerals/gas, build armies, kill your opponent.
However, Stormgate took the ""everything at once"" route, making the game bloated with a swath of features. Neutral camps, ""powers"" that the player can activate on the field, every unit having some strange quirk or activable ability that requires a bunch of tooltips to understand, supplemented by a wide range of obscure and convoluted upgrades : each units seems to have at least two or three specific upgrades that affect the unit's quirk/ability in minor ways, making the entire thing even more complicated. The introduction of the third race (Celestials) validated this approach, as the entire design of said race is a mess to understand. This makes new players unwilling to engage with the game's features, overwhelming them with an illegitimate and way too vast amount of information, while RTS veterans feel frustrated, struggling to comprehend how to design their army compositions or come up with a game plan.

To sum everything up, I'd say that the developpers built their game on terrible foundations (a bland, uninspired copy of Starcraft), and seemed to include every single thing they could think of to make the game different, and ""innovative"". Sadly, none of those ideas feel original, and the result is a bloated, unreadable mess where the map, the races, and the units interactions with one another are a struggle to comprehend.",1723987084,2024-08-18 09:18:04

steam,172376270,StarWarCraft = :D,1723973203,2024-08-18 05:26:43
steam,172375664,"Well, let's start with a good thing - 1v1 is working pretty well, is interesting to play (even tho I suck at it, same as at any other RTS) and has a great potential. That's the reason I give thumbs up here. Hopefully some day we'll have SG as main cybersport RTS discipline.

Coop is meh, gets stale pretty fast but let's give it some time to develop.

And now for the reason steam rating of Stormgate is ""mixed"" - Campaign. It's horrible. It's shite from under a dead horse. It was such a mistake to release it like this at all, I hope at least it will help them hear the community feedback and fix it. 
And here is my feedback. Let's not focus too much on the visual part because they explained it, promised to fix what's possible but most likely won't back down from this shitty Fortnite-like cheap cartoonish style anyway, so let's just ignore it for now.
What is more important and more grim is the fact management and their decisions regarding monetization plowed the storytelling front, back and sideways. We will not be getting an epic story campaign. Nothing like SC2 is on the horizon. Instead we will be milked 10$ per 3-mission packs. And what kind of epic story can you fit into such a format? None. If they would make a congruent large story and serve it on such a piece-meal basis it would be just a foul play against our wallets, dirty trick. But at least there would be a campaign to talk about. But reality is even worse than that.
Because devs envision campaign future as burping out ""short stories focused on different heroes"". You get it? Every pack is a separate thing just vaguely tied with the rest of the global plot. Barely 3 hours of dubious fun for 10$. Sounds like a Tiktok from a world of gaming to me. Marvellisation, targeting kids with an attention span of a guppie.
And you can observe those effects in play already. Ofc you don't see any charismatic characters or interesting plot twists - you just can't fit those into 3 missions. Good thing needs time to brew. But here we have some bland characterless noones (spoiler alert, hehe) who already is trying to defend the same Strahnbrad village and looking for the same Frostmourne again, but in space this time.

Well, no thanks. As more or less casual gamer I was interested in campaign the most, and from what I understand devs are expecting to monetize the development through selling the campaign but it just won't cut it. I'm not ready to spare a single penny for such a product and even less so - coughing up 10$ for another piece of nothing. 
But consider this instead - you make current rag of a campaign into a demo, hide it into some Legacy tab, scrap the whole idea of fragmented space soap opera and make us a Grand Campaign. Or even 3 of them - one for each race. With choices that matter, leveling, may be a tactical map and lots of content, plot twists and character development..
And we, gamers, send you 20$ for each campaign. Fair price. 60$ in total, real AAA scale. Whaddaya say?",1723972428,2024-08-18 05:13:48
steam,172375398,"Very fun game with some new and fresh mechanics, I really enjoy learning this new RTS.

steam,172373895,"Game is Meh. Only played 1v1.

The combat and macro speed feels like wc3, except you don't have a hero. Until you get a 3rd then the macro becomes some spammy mess that feels weird compared to the rest of the game because your buildings build very slow and bad worker AI makes the transition weird.

There are creep camps, except you don't have a hero. You get a lot of money from killing them so you have to take them, but most don't feel like they do anything. Microing or counter creeping somebody which are important in wc3 don't really matter because 1 of these creep camps is a permanent healing pool making harassing across the map not really a thing.

Then many of the units are just copies of sc2, which is fine I guess. But several of them are so absurd that I don't have any faith in them being able to balance the game properly. There are giant infernal elephants that have an ability to stomp with no collision through enemys army with an upgrade for AOE stunning. 6 of them and its just stupid and not fun. Celestials can rush air and with all of vanguard's dedicated antiair hedgehoggs and flak and hornets, you still can't stop them from coming into your base and killing a building and flying out with no punishment, again just stupid strats and not fun. Oh and their nexus and workers also fly for some reason in a game where cliffs and islands exist.

The only innovative thing I liked about the game is the bar at the top where you have choices for some abilities / effects to react to different situations.

 If there were heroes in the competitive 1v1 mode it might be fun to play, which is their coop modes I guess. Not really fun for 1v1 besides being a new game.

Didn't really enjoy watching the Tasteless Showdown either. Felt like I was literally watching wc3 grunts and fiends fight archers early but with no heroes.  If i'm missing something that makes this game fun competitively let me know.

As early access I have a lot of notes:
0. useless to choose ""login with steam at this point"" login should be  automatically.
1. Extemely slow loading for such unworked graphics.
2. Load times are extremely high, with recommended specs you still get a bad experience.
3. Techs need to be reworked to simplify the requirements to get units. more units less tech = faster games. Strategy resides on choosing wisely the early branches.
4. Graphics look horrible, cartoonish overwatch design work if they run smoothly. So horrible cartoonish and bad running is not a good combo.
5. Nice menus, simple and clear, now could be worked with the same layout to have some style.
6. Who told you the Warcraft formula is more popular than the Starcraft Formula? Please rething that to get success. People like military games. Not a hero as much.
7. Factions were ok.
8. Unable to connect to online games, unable to create lobbies until 3 attempts.

steam,172365983,"Stormgate is an interesting title from ex-Blizzard devs, who make no bones about using their existing art and design style at blizzard in their new title.

Rather than being a ripoff it appears at times to almost maliciously mock Blizzard.

The art style is a blend of Overwatch and Warcraft 3; and the game feels rather more influenced by Warcraft III than it does by Starcraft 2, despite the obvious similarities. 

All round it plays rather well, is incredibly responsive and is extremely tightly designed. That it stands out as essentially a superior version of Starcraft II is pretty much immediately evident. 

The game seems to have attracted the ire of Blizzard fans and its marketing team given by the repeated drama on the forums from thinly veiled industry veterans. This is really just icing on the cake watching Blizzard get sour at thew workers whom they ruthlessly exploited.

Unfortunately for someone of a macro RTS, as opposed to RTT, this kind of RTS style feels rather limited to me. No strategic zoom, limited scope and scale, little macro game - these aren't really things I feel people want from RTS these days.

However, despite my own preferences, I can tell it's an exceedingly well done RTS - and if you can pick two titles with the same pedigree, Starcraft 2 or Stormgate, then it's probably better to go with the company that isn't a soulless mockery of its former self. 

At the end of the day, the main drawcards for RTS games like this isn't that its perfect or preferential, but whether you can find a match when you search ranked. Stormgate offers this. 

So at the end of the day, Stormgate is your locally sourced, fresh ""organic"" produce compared to Starcraft 2, a battery farm, cruelty flavoured animal death farm.",1723957831,2024-08-18 01:10:31

For the low low price of free you get the PvP with all the races (I didn't actually try the PvP) and the Co-op mode with 1 commander for free and the rest to level 5, after they get to level 5 you can't level anymore but you can still play them, the Co-op game mode is okay, it's fun enough to get 5-8 hours out of it and not feel like you wasted that time, but it also feels unpolished. Probably balanced around the pvp and we just get the same base units for the Co-op.
I think the only thing I really don't like in the game is the human faction models, especially Amara's face. The balance is okay but needs work IMO, but it's not enough to make the game...bad, just eeh.
The pricing for the campaign and the commanders past level 5 is a bit too high IMO for what you get in quality content, but you can get lots of content and a feel for if you want more through the F2P portion of the game before you decide to invest more than just time into the game.",1723934041,2024-08-17 18:34:01

steam,172349232,"This game has such a great, smooth feel to the gameplay. For an RTS, from an indie studio, in a FREE Early Access, I'm amazed by the quality provided. It's not the polished quality of the giants that have been around for a decade, but the team has a great start with this early version. The factions play totally differently but have such similar hotkeys and build progressions that you don't need to struggle to learn each of them from the ground up. The maps are generally well-designed and use the camp/tower/strategic point system to great effect. Most of the problems I've encountered are weird pathing issues, which I would expect will get sorted out before the full release. 

The free missions of the campaign are exactly what you would expect, they're very similar to the first few missions of StarCraft 2 which means you aren't going to get a full RTS experience from them. But then you can go to the Custom game section and test your army out against AI in 3 current practice modes - one that only defends itself (peaceful), one that regularly sends small squads to attack (Basic), and one that expands and techs up while attacking (practice). For newcomers to the genre, this game includes the Buddy Bot, a MASSIVELY helpful tool for casual players who just want to jump in a few games with their friends once a week or so. The Buddy Bot makes some odd decisions at times, but it takes care of resource gathering and production so you only have to worry about managing your army and watching the map. It won't win many PvP games, but I'm sure it will take the pressure off casual players that get frustrated trying to manage their base while being attacked.

Overall, I'm very excited to see new features come out - hopefully big improvements on Replays, maybe a Map Editor, and of course some bug fixes and improvements. But it's SO important that people who play this remember that this is an early access game from a small team, the focus has clearly been on core gameplay elements and not the extra frills as much. More will come! But only if we support the game in these early days.",1723933711,2024-08-17 18:28:31

I love that it is essentially wacraft 3 with starcraft skins and characters in the campaign.

I hate that the art style of the cut scenes looks like Fortnite meets Battle Angel Alita.

I love that the campaign looks like it has branching paths (if done well).

I hate that the presentation isn't even as good as any of the Starcraft 2 menu stuff. (The CG videos look too much like the in engine cutscenes. Like, look at the art in just the DLC for Alara. How do you get from that to this in game model? I don't get it. This is what you get when you outsource your art team to eastern europe and china).

Love that it has the playfulness of warcraft 3.

Hate that it somehow takes itself too seriously despite the characters looking like action figures. (Warcraft 3 took itself just seriously enough, had much better voice actors, and the proportions of the hero characters seemed less goofy by comparison).

Love Stryker.

Hate Amara. (Mostly VO, definitely the models, absolutely the introductions. I'm already rolling my eyes at the daddy story that obviously will have her finding some remnant of her father in further campaign missions like maybe he's corrupted or something. Get someone who didn't grow up on Eragon to write your narrative please.)

I hate that I have 3 hero units in the first mission.

I hate that when I right click, I just face that direction rather than turning.

I hate that when a melee unit attacks me when i'm kiting with Alara, she never takes damage even when the animation on the melee character completes.

I hate that the concept is cool, but the campaign doesn't think I have a long enough attention span to have a slow build. Here's a hero, right click with it, people are captured by chaos 40k marines, here's another hero, pick up this item for pointless story fluff, here's another hero, make a compelling choice that you have no idea what the repercussions will be, end mission.

I hate that Alara's dad looks like Sacha Baron Cohen but isn't voiced by him.

You made an RTS for Fortnite and Minecraft kids instead of people who like RTS.

I'm probably gonna buy the founders pack anyway, tho. You probably shouldn't, but Steam doesn't have a maybe button because that's all anyone would click.

You are way to zoomed in and OMG it is so slow paced and boring. Im really sorry guys I know we had high hoped for this one but unfortunatly we have been scammed.

They just sorta remade Starcraft 2, with units lasting a bit longer, everyone being a spellcaster and some units having autocast.

The problem is, SC2 is a much better, more optimised and well balanced game. The rig with a 3080 hits like 15-20 fps in this game, I can get 10x times that in SC2, it looks prettier, more responsive and less clunky, with a UI that's understandable.

The reason why SC2 died, is because it was no longer fun. For some reason they took the same concept and instead of innovating, they doubled down on it.
Last year, everyone was just massing Tier 1 units, this year it's pretty much the same. You never really see opponents going for a 3rd.

At least be honest with your players. I wouldn't mind paying a full price for a game so I could play the campaign and PvE/PvP online modes, but the way the devs chose to monetize the game its both insulting and absurd.
You have to pay to unlock each mission. Each coop hero costs as much as a high-end indie game. There is no option to ""one time buy the game"" nor a  ""Coop hero bundle DLC"" on a fair price so you're stuck with this POS monetization.
Don't download it. Don't buy it. Don't endorse in any way, shape or form this kind of attitude comming from devs.
I hope you all have learned the lesson from the DLC and microtransactions and doesn't let another toxic trend rise up such as this game.

What I'm really hoping to see is that they will make some major changes to the game or, come up with some major new game modes going forward, because if all they do is fix and polish, this will perhaps be a good successor to SC2, but what we're all really hoping for of course is the game that will resurrect the RTS genre and restore it to it's former glory.

steam,172338331,"I'm glad this game is finally in EA so I can review it.
Overall, this game was a let down. Does it have potential? Maybe. But the game feels so bland and generic, even for a Beta/EA game.
- The races are literally Terran/Zerg/Protoss, only worse because they have less of an identity
- The game looks like a mobile game from 2010
- The unit pathing and movement is so clunky. Most of the time you feel like you're fighting the game, not your opponent. Many units are just so large and slow that any units that kite have a huge advantage.
- There is almost no unit distinction, it's gotten better as they've ""upgraded"" the graphics, but it can be hard to tell things apart when watching matches or even when playing. 
- They have controversy surrounding their funding for this game, initially saying they were totally funded through EA via KS, then doubling back and saying they weren't and asking for some NFT scam levels of user investment. I'm not gonna go as far as to say the studio is intentionally scamming people, I just think they are incompetent and didn't secure enough funding nor implement the MTX they needed early enough to allow them to fund the game further. It's costing them an obscene amount of money monthly and they have ZERO REVENUE. 

The sad part is, this game really did do some things right. There are a lot of QOL fixes that make the game easier to learn and to play. I like that it's a bit slower paced and your entire worker line isn't dying because you didn't micro away from some garbo unit within .5 seconds. I like that the game has areas of the map you are contesting through creeps for a small eco boost. It feels like all these things should make for a fun experience, but in reality, it's just boring and feels like an RTS from 2006 with some minor improvements. This is supposed to be the next gen of RTS e-sports? I'll stick with SC2.

I hope the game improves, I hope in a few years it's still around and it has found it's footing and looks and plays a lot better. But this is gonna be the last time I ever fund a game through KS, what a waste. Lesson learned, don't trust KS game companies, even if they are a team that made some of the greatest games of all time.

The campaign is in early access, but only the first 3 missions are available unless you purchase the the chapters. I can see that getting expensive quick when you account for each campaign having multiple chapters and there being multiple campaigns. Gone are the days where you just buy a game and get the game I guess.

On top of those campaign issues, they also boast their co-op mode. I haven't been able to do much of this since I don't have friends who play it, but I did do some. You have to purchase heroes much like how Starcraft 2 does it. It really feels like I'm being nickeled and dimed. As is I would suggest passing on this game.

The campaign does not engage me in a way where I want to go back, the sound design and the voice acting is more annoying than engaging. I actually found myself turning in game sounds off and leaving only the music on. 
ol------------------------------------------------------- <- thanks for the insight cat.
I can't complain about the length as its early access. 

Coop:
I played 3 coop missions, in those coop missions I played starcraft 2's:
Train heist coop mission - with a variation to kill enemy base while preventing convoys from entering the base.
Train heist coop mission, reskinned on a different map 
Infested terran hold out mission, but it was 3 player coop.
I get that you guys DEVELOPED SC2... but no one wants to play the same exact game, but implemented in a worse way. 
Again, sound design. 
Every single time I destroyed a convoy, the same audio file was played. 
When i destroyed the enemy base:
""Oh no my ion thingy was destroyed, too bad I'll just make ion thingy 2 and destroy you later muahaha""
Talk about cringe.

I am sorry but I tried, but best to say ""try"" happened on the main manu that just presents the first 3 free missions, and the next three with a price tag symbol, discovering that no, you don't get whole campaigns as dlc, but actually 3 missions or single chapters at a time. Now maybe the pvp is better? well Starcraft wins again as Stormgate has far less units, less buildings, and lets be honest. the mechanics are copy and paste from Starcraft. Hell the first vehicle unit you get is like a modified siege tank that when hunkered down is anti air. now is it viable hunkering mid combat? probably not and it doesn't give you much reason too. While starcraft makes far more sense with a tank able to switch into a mortar mode that makes it really useful as a defense and offense and often having advantages in high places. all while there are anti air turrets back at base, and as a reminder those two things are from starcraft while stormgate has a ranged attack/hunkered anti air, no turrets to compensate for that, and relying completely on units for defense. there aren't even bunkers. I am legitimately scared to find out what the other factions are like.

Even outside of the story the quality and repeatability would have to be extremely high and this is just isn't there.

Each co-op commander is a separate ""micro"" transaction. This game is designed to require tons of small purchases.

Gameplay wise it feels like wc3 but everything is covered in melted butter. Had bizarre bugs in co-op like all units suddenly becoming unable to take damage about 30 seconds before we would have won, leading to a lost scenario. In the campaign Angry Gun Lady clipped and got stuck in between two trees which again resulted in a lost scenario.

I had more fun on my 1000th hour of SC2 or WC3 than I did on my 10th of SG.

So, imagine you take StarCraft 2, strip all the atmosphere, interesting lore and unique units from it and make it completely sterile. This is how this game feels, it is almost like it's made by AI. Most basic, sterile, safe-made RTS I've ever played. 

StarCraft 2 is F2P, it's a great game, with active community, better graphics and better gameplay.

steam,172324264,"[h1]Campaign Mode[/h1]

If you're a fan of Warcraft III or StarCraft, this is a huge disappointment. Don’t expect any smart storytelling like in Warcraft. It’s just about strong boss women shooting buildings and robots. It’s nowhere near the quality of even the worst Warcraft story. There’s no good dialogue, no interesting characters, and no cutscenes. I assure you, you won’t remember anything after finishing any of the campaigns. The free-to-play campaigns (first three missions) took about 20 minutes, and after that, you have to pay.

[h1]Multiplayer (1v1 Mode)[/h1]

The 1v1 mode is fun, and the factions have unique mechanics. The problem is the game offers nothing else after you finish the campaign. All you can do is 1v1. Once you learn the build order and start rushing your opponent, it gets boring really fast since there are only three factions and not many strategies.

[h1]Custom Maps[/h1]

This is the biggest loss of the game. There’s no map editor yet. Imagine if they had something even close to the Warcraft III map editor at release. They showcased an editor that looked great for developers to work with, and we could have had a lot of custom maps. It’s sad to see that while they aimed to recapture their old games like StarCraft, they forgot the parts that made StarCraft great.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

You don’t really care about graphics in an RTS game, but art style is very important. I would have preferred a more realistic style because I don’t like units that look like they’re from a mobile game. I believe it was a poor design choice to go with cartoony, less realistic, colorful units that look like candy balloons in a game aiming to be like StarCraft.
",1723907618,2024-08-17 11:13:38
steam,172324094,"I would generally give this game a positive review but the microtransaction model of paying 10€ for 3 missions, each of which maybe take 15-20 minutes and the pretty clear shoving aside anything except competitive 1v1 for that esports acclaim and money makes me not want to do that.

I personally play games mostly for lore and immersion and while this game is in early access I feel like they are just not even gonna bother to flesh out the story. The plot points are rushed through to get to a conclusion like in Warcraft 3 but it feels soulless and unearned. There was so much thought in dialogue in Warcraft 3 and every cutscene and plot point, though also proceeding relatively quickly, felt well paced and real.

It really is awful where Blizzard is today and I haven't played their games in years out of principle but this somehow feels equally as corporate and soulless and I hate to say it but this game gives me the vibe of being a wannabe cash-in on the 1v1 RTS esports scene, which doesn't have much besides the Starcraft games. The replayability of the campaign is just non-existant as of now and I will get to why in a bit.

The games units are fine design-wise, though lacking in responsiveness (which you can excuse because of it being early access). The sound design is just there, it gets the job done but not more. Some units I noticed have like 2 voice lines for movement and if you keep clicking (as you do in RTS games) you will have them constantly saying the same 2 things and each click starts a voice line if there isn't one active. Stuff like this can get annoying.

The models are...horrifying. It does say that the cutscenes are a work in progress but I seriously can not imagine anything much better to replace this. The main character is the worst offender, looking like a melted wax figurine combined with some FNAF animatronic. Additionally the mouths are not even moving most of the time and the eyes roll around in their sockets without any facial movement.

I don't want to overexaggerate too much but this game gives me the feeling of a failed 1v1 esports chaser that is going to run out of funding way before it gets out of early access. A situation like we had before, where instead of getting to the finish line and then releasing, they will cut their losses and go 60-70% of the way, then release the content they got until then and say ""ok it is finished, that will do for the next 3 years. We will probably return to it at some point...maybe...hopefully"".

I don't even want to accuse the people behind this of being shitty or greedy, I think they were genuine. But they focused on the superficial 1v1 aspect. The aspect players get to when they like the base game and have already replayed the campaign lots of times, like back with Starcraft and Warcraft. It was the same with Blizzard and hard forcing esports competitive content in WoW in Mythic+ dungeons. Instead of being something you do in addition to a base game you already love and replayed a lot, you are shoved in there by the devs without having anything else to do. Because esports are more lucrative and hyped than doing a good job at a base game that is already solid.

Where did the 40 million in funding go? We know what indie games can look like, with examples like Last Epoch and Trepang. Slightly scuffed but very close to what you would expect from companies 10 times larger. This company is 10 times larger but delivers a tenth of what to expect. What happened behind the scenes here? If this game is already struggling with funding now, to the point these pricing models are needed, I highly doubt that like 3k people (judging by SteamCharts) paying 10€ each is going to give them the ability to finish this game. This very very much feels like it is already dead and we are just 5 delayed roadmaps away from it being ""finished"" with a bit over half the promised content being done.",1723907475,2024-08-17 11:11:15
steam,172323507,"[h1] NOT RIGHT NOW [/h1]

While the game play is smooth and responsive, the graphics and art style are silly, childish, and uninspiring. There have been widespread concerns about the art style since the very first images were shown off by the devs, and while I'm perfectly fine with playing games that don't feature cutting edge graphics (I still play WC3 on classic graphics), the art style just doesn't match the overall theme of the game. Then again, it's hard to tell what vibe they are trying to go with. On one hand you have a demonic horde invading, and on the other hand you have pet chickens. Is Stormgate trying to be serious or goofy? They need to choose, because a hybrid of both just doesn't work in this instance. 

I'm holding out hope that Frost Giant fixes the hideous art style and decides which direction they want to take their story. But until they do, I can't recommend spending and real $$$ on this game.",1723906933,2024-08-17 11:02:13
steam,172323436,"I was going to give this game a thumbs up but the more I played the more flaws I saw.  I'll explain a few of my issues that come to mind.

1. Purchasable heroes.  I understand this is really only for 3vE Co-Op and that they let you play the characters for free until level 5, but not giving players an alternate way of earning them (grinding daily/monthly missions, etc etc) is always a slap in the face.  I understand this game is F2P but some of the micro transactions are a bit much.  

2. UNIT COLLISION.  I absolutely hate this in almost any game I play.  Watching a group of my melee units pacing back and forth behind my ranged units during a fight is comical.  The pathing is terrible right now with units and I know that'll get improved over time but... unit collision? really? at the very least disable it for our own units. 

3.  Nothing really new.  Having played the Warcraft series and Starcraft series, I feel like there was no originality brought into this game, sure the factions have different names.  But come on.. Infernals using creep? Celestial is basically Protoss? A little more effort could have gone into making these factions unique and different without feeling like a carbon copy of another game.  It feels like this is just a quick attempt to capture people's attention with Starcraft elements and then not build from there.

4.  UI scaling and unit scaling.  Everything seems so... big? Like i'm playing on a lower resolution.  The UI takes up so much space on the screen and the armies start getting so big they dont all fit on the screen at certain times.  Being able to adjust this would be amazing.

This game does have potential but again, and I really can't shake this feeling, it just feels like a lazy attempt to carbon copy Starcraft.. I know the game is still Early Access and that they plan on releasing more content but as of right now I cannot recommend the game.  As far as stuff that's already set in stone.. I don't see them changing factions to make them feel more unique.  

I'll keep my eye on this game and I hope it proves me wrong.

It feels like it tries to twist and one up on the legacy of previous RTSes (can't hide Warcraft and Starcraft influences), but while trying to twist on the formula it kinda... forgot the basics? Units can't easily be differentiated and there's clumping. Co-op has massive fps issues. The graphic style feels very... fortnity? Which wouldn't inherently be bad but it all feels kinda bland now. The existing campaign is just Arthas storyline with a Xel-Naga drill mission and a cutscene that is essentially Arthas vs Illidan but worse. Pathing can be pretty meh. Co-op difficulty is either very easy or very hard on the same difficulty level. 

Also I've spent A LOT of money on kickstarter and got slapped with a day one early access 9 quid microtransaction.

There is nothing new or innovative in this game, they just took what was already done at Blizzard, and then did it in a weaker way. The story is weak and was probably written by a teenager who couldn't get his hands on a book in his life. Uninteresting characters, units. Uninteresting buildings. Uninteresting factions. Cliché collection. It's just nothing. I don't care about technical problems, early access.

steam,172318291,"Horrible, I played the free campaign missions and ~10 1v1s.
The game feels cheap and soulless. The art design is bad, but the audio design is even worse. Volume is all over the place and the sound effects+voice lines are gratingly terrible to the point where I'd consider to play the game without any sound. The music is ok though.

In terms of gameplay Stormgate is SC2s drooling, cross-eyed cousin who'll occasionally poop his pants. I don't like SC2 and think it's heavily flawed by design, but at least it feels good to play. In Stormgate, basic things sometimes refuse to work. Want to add units to your control group? Stormgate says: try again buddy. Want to shift-select additional units to your current selection? Nope, try again. Pathfinding is funky and units like to get stuck on bulidings and on each other. I have more trust in Broodwar's Goliaths to reach their goal than in any of the units in Stormgate. 
I also think that there are too many unit abilities and that many of them are unintuitively designed and cumbersome to use.
WC3 handled abilites way better 20 years ago.

The campaign is boring, the characters are bland and badly voiced (except for Matt Mercer's character). The whole story setup is uninteresting and doesn't manage to keep me invested. I don't know why I should care about any of this. Maybe if the story took place in an earlier spot within the timeline it would be easier to care. Also who thought that a massive amount of collectable textlogs (similar to an immersive sim) would be a good idea for a RTS? Of course I'm not reading any of that in that tiny window during a campaign mission. 

The performance is quite bad, regardless of the settings used and despite easily exceeding the recommended specs. The game never feels fluid and while rollback netcode is a must-have for fighting games, I don't think adding it was worth it for Stormgate.

I know this is early access and some things can and should be excused, but Stormgate was nowhere near ready for public access. Especially with these outrageously overpriced microtransactions. Every single major retail RTS offers better value for the amount of money spent. Even if Stormgate was a more polished product, the campaign content would still be massively overpriced.

From what I've seen, I don't think there is any potential for Stormgate to be the promised ""next-gen RTS"".

Another doomed free2play game, with dated cartoony graphics and tamed/simplified gameplay.
A product of miss-interpretations of charts and stats, with no clue what people want, need or expect from games.
So in its core design it simply feels unprofessional, raw, clunky and boring.

They use already a fictional setting, still all units share same shape and colours, while they look cheap and lazy. The base build and tactics suffer, suffers from too small and simple map design. So you just snowball your unit blob from base to expansions that to enemy.


There are many other new RTS out there that look better,
where gameplay is more fluent and with better AI.

Eventually I build some army and send them to glorious battle, and they just stand there swing their little swords and shooting from their little rifles.
And I realise that those battles do not have any weight to them.
There are some units that I cannot even tell if they are doing anything ,like the carrier just flies there and I don't know if it is shooting or not, hard to tell.
Oh I make some units and; I'm in a fight so the muscle memory from StarCraft 2 kicks in and I press F2 and nothing ,no selecting every unit on map on this button.
Stormgate is this idea of a game that tries really hard to be StarCraft 2 but in the process of making it they take all of its flaws ,not make any good additions and at the end say ""hope you like it"".

What got people into Warcraft and Starcraft and Command and Conquer back in the day was the campaign, and all those games delivered. 

The story that Frost Giant have conjured here uses every horrible trope from the past decade you can imagine. Girl bosses, weak men, a complete lack of story, purpose, or direction, and misplaced comedy that misses almost every mark it sets to hit. 

Most of the story is stolen directly from Warcraft 3. Even the first mission is almost a copy of Warcraft 3's first Human mission. You even have the slaver. It gets worse, you have the space marine ethnic Uther, you have girlboss Arthas, you have the drill from Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty, and you have Frostmourne all in one neat little package, all voiced by horrible voice actors who I imagine were just as bored reading their lines as I was hearing them.

If I were an employee at Frost Giant I'd be looking for a job as soon as possible just to avoid being associated with this.

steam,172309392,"A half-baked early access game, touted to be the spiritual successor of the Starcraft 2, by former developers of that game + Warcraft 3 and some parts of Red Alert 2 (look around in their KickStarter page). I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game right now.

The 'early access' excuse can only go so far. They had been developing this game for quite a while now (yes, I had been following them). Their KickStarter went way beyond their original goal. Yet, despite the excuse of 'early access' can apply to the gameplay, graphics, sounds and certain features hid prematurely behind credit cards (as one reviewer had put it aptly; you can take the devs from Blizzard but you can't take Blizzard from them), what's the excuse of the flat story telling and the horrendously clunky dialogues?

The games I mentioned are known to have gripping story lines, even starting from the first missions. The dialogues may at times be cheesy but they are well developed. No, I'm not talking about the way the wooden voice actors that delivers those lines. I'm talking about the wooden [i]script[/i].

""It's RTS. They don't really need a good story to be a good game"". If that's the reaction, I have to ask if you're stupid. I'll mention this again as it's worth mentioning [i]twice[/i]; this game had been touted to be a spiritual successor to StarCraft 2 by many, a game which is backed by a good story telling. By professional reviewers, magazines and I dare say it was the original vision of this team of developers themselves. 

If you don't have the gameplay, graphics and sounds to back it up, plus the story and the dialogue was abandoned, what is left for this game to appeal to RTS fans? Multiplayer? The potential for esports? With some of the factions hid behind the paywall in a game that is not [b]quite done yet[/b]? So, make the game in favor of the professional gamers while alienating many longtime casual fans of the games I mentioned?

You may react that this is a free to play game and it's early access. And I have to remind you, this is not quite a free to play game when you have to pay for certain features and they got over 2 mils pledged already for this game by people, who by the way, I'd wager most of them are not their studio's shareholders. Most of the money might've already been sunk into the project but the parts that went wrong were not the amount of efforts or money; they were the plannings and directions for the game. And it [i]shows[/i]

To the veteran developers of the studio who had been marketing themselves as developers of the games that I mentioned, I say this to you: wake up. I want you guys to succeed but you need to seriously rethink your strategies.

All RTS games take a considerable amount of time before they are finished and balanced. 
StarCraft 1, which I consider to be the masterpiece of the RTS genre, did it, StarCraft 2 did it (and even that game still gets balance patches from time to time).
Stormgate is following in that footsteps.

People tend to want everything to be perfect from the start.
Then why is there such a thing as early access?
Isn't that what it's all about, communicating with users and actively reflecting the roadmap?
I'm as tired as anyone of the idea of making a good game and then neglecting it.

The main story seems to be painfully cringe only putting the salt on the sc2 wound, didnt see anything interesting in terms of story gameplay wise either, but i guess we'll see where it goes. The design and theme choice is questionable at best, the cartoonish feel doesnt really hit the spot and comes off a wee bit bland, lacking some inspiration on its own turf, thought it has its moments with certain animations and effects in its minimalistic art style.
At first it comes off as a ""back 4 blood"" of left 4 dead situation, where the devs teasing you by their involvement with the previous franchise and their plans to bring back sth that has been missed by a certain community so much, that being sc2, but accidentally setting expectations in a way that should not be set to be compared with the amount of effort put previously by a much bigger talented team.
In 1v1 skirmish games that ive tried, however. This game does look like it wants to become something but imo it needs quite a bit of time, talent, crunch, iteration and inspiration to break through.
IMO. Now if we ARE comparing this game to sc and sc2, im sure that the first thing would come to minds of most of the francise's fans is not the multiplayer (althought that does too for sc1 esp), but the identity of it. It wasnt only about the gameplay. people recall the iconic units, the stories behind their factions, the stories of their heroes and the setting they are in. The games are so beloved bec there were so many things that had to come together that has become so iconic and memorable, and that ripping only a piece of that out thinking that that would suffice would be a fail from the start.

Wish the devs luck and confidence in each other to build sth that inspires both them and the community to make a game that they themselves would love to play. Aaand not shoot themselves in the foot while doing so with... questionable practices like the Warz situation, seriously... not cool.

For me, I felt like switching of from name brand cold cereal for something generic...like Lucky Charms to Marshmallow Magic, or Cinnamon Toast Crunch to Bunch O’ Cinnamon Squares, or Fruit Loops to Fruitti Rings...sorry I kept thinking about that while I was playing 😅

They talk about a lot with stock figures and graphics will improve, but that is of lower priority for me compared to something that is just fun to play, well balanced, and has a great solo and multiplayer modes. I also was suprised at how low my fps was with the game. I dont have a gaming machine (Intel i5-11320H with a Iris Xe graphics) but I can play most games without an issue on the low spec options. With this, I barely got 12-20fps in game and cut scenes were 3fps, which was suprising to me because its not that complex of a video game visually.

While I would not recommend this as being a great game, it is worth playing for a bit to see if it fits your personality. I can see it over time becoming popular as an alternative for RTS matches.

It appears, however, to be the sort of game that chops itself up into pieces. And the pieces are not worth the price. The game is worth maybe 30 bucks for the whole thing in it's present state. That's what I'd be willing to pay. 30 bucks is less than it costs to purchase all of the co-op commanders.

I don't think the pieces will EVER be worth their current prices, even if this game is polished to a theoretical endpoint. The game will at best be worth like 60~ bucks. I'd be willing to buy all the co-op commanders, together, for like 5 bucks, maybe. If future additions were included.

So, that's my issue really. The micro-transaction greed. Wish they'd just slapped a price tag on the game. Hate this live service bullshit. Otherwise, it's a clearly early access but still good RTS that is above average quality for a modern RTS, but compared to older RTS is pretty middling. Perhaps that will change in the long term.

Now suppose that many of the craftsmen who helped build one of these great structures decided to band together to make something new, but without many of the people that originally formed the integral glue and guiding force that originally kept the operation together. The architect is gone, as is the person with enough vision to commission a great monument, and many of the foremen who kept construction running aren't involved. Those craftsmen might make something with decent elements reminiscent of their previous work, but it lacks cohesion. The leadership and process that would have made them create something magnificent that is more than the sum of its parts is simply not there. Instead, there is just an inelegant jumble. That is what Stormgate is as a video game

The game itself is an unimaginative rehash of Blizzard's greatest hits. It's like someone threw WarCraft, StarCraft, and Diablo into a blender and poured you a tall glass of the resulting slop, sprinkling the stale leftovers of Overwatch's aesthetic on top. Familiar elements are there, but lacking the context and structure that made them anything worthwhile in the first place. This leads to an incoherent tone that is all over the place. On one hand, this game tries to strike a gritty and dark tone with a demonic invasion of earth and an anti-hero protagonist who does questionable things. On the other, the art direction is incredibly cartoony, the dialogue is cliche, and you spend time trying to rescue someone's chicken. These are not issues that can be fixed with more polish and development time; they at this point an integral part of the game.

I realize this is early access, but I can't review what the game MIGHT become, merely what it currently is. Currently it is a butt ugly reminder of better games. What I have heard and seen from the developers does not fill me with optimism. They seem to be in full blown cope mode and ignoring just how badly their game presents itself.

steam,172287729,"Alright so I played this game, a lot of problems out the gate. Serious performance issues for no reason, key mechanics like stutter stepping feel terrible because they decided to do SC2 attack animations with WC3 turning speeds for some reason. The game can't seem to decide if it wants to be WC, SC or Diablo. What really confused me was when I realised it has TWO loading screens just to boot a mission and you can't continue the campaign when done with it, you just get booted back to menu. 

That was really odd to me because this game is meant to be made by SC/WC vets, but those games don't have these weird design choices so I looked into it. Turns out the founder of this studio has only worked in the industry in one other job for five years, Morten was the production director on LOTV. I was not familiar with that role in the games industry so I had to look into that, it barely exists and best I could find he was basically an over qualified budget person. So he did numbers for 5 years before this, not a great start. Worth adding he worked there from 2014-2019, baring in mind LOTV dropped in 2015 so he wasn't really involved with the majority of this development, he was more like support staff for after it released. His actual experience in MAKING games is about a year.

But hey, there's still Cambell the director for this game, he worked on early C&C plus WC, now here is some promise. Except there isn't, because as far as I can tell the last RTS he worked on was WC3 ROC, which dropped 22 years ago. Granted he directed wasteland 3 which is awesome but not an RTS and i can't find anything he worked on between those two games.

So the WC/SC vets we were promised turned out to be a guy with five years experience being in charge of budgets and a guy who last worked in RTS when they were still making Lord of The Rings movies. While I'm sure they probably have other talented people, those are the two most important people on the project and it explains a lot.

I hope I can change this review later to be positive but as it stands, I don't have a lot of faith and honestly they have a lot of work to do if they want to make something remotely similar to what they hyped up.",1723860255,2024-08-16 22:04:15

This is early access so I wont be too nitpicky but I'll mention that if you're playing for co-op at the time of writing there are only 5 factions, ONE you get for free, the others cost 10$ which I think it's fair to say is on the heavier side, while I consider this a negative I think that most reasonable people are willing to pay a premium if they think the devs are making good use of the funds. This remains to be seen but I am optimistic.

With a few more bugfixes and quality of life.. I think it'll be a pretty neat game.",1723857783,2024-08-16 21:23:03

With Co-op missions being 3 players how can only one commander be unlocked to the majority of your players?  Additional commanders are $10 which is pretty steep given how many commanders you'd want in game to make a robust experience long term.  Killed all hype I had dead.,1723855416,2024-08-16 20:43:36

Suppose to be more accessible for new rts players. I found it more difficult to control than sc2. When your army gets bigger they all get stuck on each other. The easy build saves you like 1 or 2 hot keys only, however it gives you less control over which builder builds and where it takes them from.

steam,172280454,"Updated: This game is no longer early access. It still makes me wish I was playing a better game.  Hard pass, unless it turns into, basically, an entirely different game in a year.

This game is free to play and early access. That gives it some leeway in what I'm expecting. It also reminds you, a lot, that it's in early access. The more they throw that up and remind you that it's in Early Access, the more kind of worried I get, and they've said it'll be in early for about a year or more maybe. But already there's a fully functional store in the game. Now, I have a high tolerance for parceling out a game and selling it piecemeal- I play Paradox games, and every year or so I pay full retail price for whatever updates Stellaris has gotten to go on a month-long binge.

A big part of what's worrying me is that I don't know what I'm getting into. Co-op seems kind of neat, but the one hero doesn't feel like a great introduction to everything, and there's no ""play this until level 5 of 15 to see what it's all about"" thing going on, just ten bucks a commander entry fee. There's three prologue missions for the campaign- I played through two and I'll come back to them- and another three that I can pay ten bucks for, or get the ""whole first campaign"" for $25. But I don't know how big that whole first campaign is- some of the DLC pages say that it'll be three chapters and we can hope that they're all about the same size but... man nine missions for $25 is kind of steep, especially when you compare it to... but I'll get to that later.

Speaking of co-op some more- thank you to the commenter- the voice lines are hashed to hell, to quote Archer, ""dial it down, trainspotting"", and the missions I've played felt bland. It could also be that three players is... a lot? There's also no feeling of power progression through the tech tree, and the hero leveling process is painfully slow. This is exacerbated by it not showing how much more EXP you need to level up, but it seems like about 5-8 games on normal is needed to go from level 3 to 4 (of 10).

The gameplay is fine, it feels somewhere between Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 from what I played, although the heroes don't seem as dynamic or RPG-ish, but that's also because they're obviously not fully functional due to it being the start of the story. There's some neat features, like global production AND building, pulling a resource gatherer to build and returning him to work after he's done. The scale feels closer to WC3, which can cause issues because the pathfinding feels like Age of Empires- the original one. I often found my ranged troops blocking the melee troops, so formations or improved pathfinding/pushing friendly units would be great- unless that kind of micro is expected. 

So I want to be clear, I didn't kickstart this game. I first heard of it a few weeks ago. I haven't paid anything for this game yet- and I probably won't, at least not any time soon.

This game exists as a shadow of Blizzard games, especially Starcraft 2, but there's some Warcraft 3 and Overwatch/Diablo in there, especially in the hero system and aesthetics, respectively. But mostly, the framework of the game, the main menu and game modes are basically a copy of Starcraft 2. There is nothing here that makes me consider this versus Starcraft 2. Playing this makes me wish I was playing Starcraft 2. Starcraft 2 came out 15 years ago, and nothing here stands out. And if you think it's unfair to compare a brand new game to the titans of the industry, well, they leaned on their connections to Blizzard to market themselves, and the BOB has some of the same lines as the SCV.

To a certain extent, everything I have an issue with can be explained by early access. During the two missions I played, I was disconnected twice. There's a character who it's unclear if he's named Barclay or Blockade. The story is the opener to the Human campaign of WC3 with a female Reaper from Overwatch as the main character. I'm not expecting something groundbreaking, but I'm expecting something that isn't a beat for beat recreation of a known thing. Now, it may change if I go deeper, but if it doesn't grab me up front, I may never get there. I think my biggest problem with blaming anything on Early Access, though, is that there's SO MUCH being blamed on it. There's no part of it that feels like they wanted this thing, this facet to stand out. There's never a moment of excitement about a feature, a component, the story or the gameplay loop. Everything feels blandly undercooked in its entirety as a copy of Starcraft 2. It's ordering a Blizzard game off of Alibaba, except that the Blizzard games are right over there and cheaper because they're old.

steam,172277075,"[h1]Disclaimer[/h1]
I only played the 3 free campaign missions on Brutal + 1 co-op match on Hard.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
This EA free access has saved me money.

Bad artstyle, weak sound design, boring missions and story. It was supposed to make me buy the full version, but succeeded in doing the opposite. It's not as big of a disappointment as Homeworld 3 was, but it's the second worst RTS game coming out this year.

[h1]Description[/h1]
You play as a lady with caricature proportions who fights against mutants in a post-apocalyptic world that also has magic in it.

Game controls very similarly to Starcraft 2. There's also some similarity with units. There are 3 races and they are based on those from Starcraft.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]+ Streamlining controls[/b]
You have a global build button that will automatically order nearest worker to get off resources and construct a building, then the worker will return to mining.

There are also global queues for unit training and upgrades. It all works well, I like it.

[b]+ Pathfinding[/b]
Generally as good as in Starcraft 2.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]- Graphics style[/b]
Characters have large heads, long arms and tiny bodies. They are caricatures. With Fortnite-ish style on top of that the game looks goofy. Units tend to have large round shapes making them look like child toys and not machines of war.

[b]- Character design[/b]
Aside from wonky proportions everybody looks like a mutant of some kind. Especially the main heroine doesn't really look like a woman. She looks seriously off putting.

[b]- Sound design[/b]
Shots, hits and unit voices all sound like they are from far away. There's no punch to how fights are playing out in terms of audio. Music is really bland and boring. The exact opposite of music from Starcraft 1.

[b]- Boring missions[/b]
Only the 3rd mission in the campaign was relatively interesting, with base building and multiple objectives. First was a hero mission (*yawn*), the second was a simplistic base building one with 0 challange.

[b]- Expensive[/b]
Don't let free tag fool you. If you want to buy all co-op commanders (you get only 1 for free) and access to other parts of the game like full campaign it will cost you as much as a AAA title and the quality of stuff here is just not up to snuff.

[b]- Items[/b]
No values on how much armor/damage they give you.

[h1]Lowdown[/h1]
Try it out yourself. I hope you will get a different experience from me. I'm uninstalling it and will probably never interact with this game again.

Will be interesting to see if they can get W3 or SC2 players get into this. Maybe if they pay them?

I didn't mention bugs like some heroes not being able to pick up items because this is EA and even I won't be that petty. Silly bugs are probably going to get fixed.

Starcraft II is more or less dead to any sort of new audience, so why should I expect your Starcraft clone to not die the same death but quicker? The only good thing is that they're trying, supposedly developing it, and it's art style I guess is newer. Good luck but I don't have any high hopes so far.

I understand that the developers set themselves up for disappointment when they constantly compared themselves to the best RTS games of all time, but this game has some really smart mechanics and design decisions that I really enjoy. I'll talk about a few. 

1. People complain about the art, but I got used to it after a few games and the visual clarity is just fine, which is what I care most about as a competitive player.

2. The exo speed boost only triggering after it attacks. This forces you to kite and control well to use them efficiently, or even to retreat.

3. the lack of blanket +1 upgrades means you can pivot techs more often and your units feel viable throughout the game. You lose some strategies that rely on early upgrades or timings, but I think unit specific upgrades fill that role just fine.

4. I thought I would hate creeps as a sc2 player, but I think they add a lot of dynamics to the game. You can choose to sacrifice economy for map control and creep value.

5. The pacing of the game feels great to me. I feel like I have room to breathe but I've been caught off guard by early pressure. None of the early stuff is that frustrating because I feel like I have plenty of tools to deal with it if I play correctly.

Stop releasing unfinished games! Stormgate is the latest example of a promising concept ruined by the Early Access plague. It's a half-baked mess, clearly not ready for public consumption.

The gameplay is clunky and unbalanced. It's obvious the core mechanics haven't been properly developed. And don't even get me started on the in-game purchases. It's a blatant cash grab, preying on players' hopes for a good game.

The developers should be ashamed of themselves. They're taking advantage of the Early Access system to release a subpar product and make a quick buck. It's disrespectful to the players and damaging to the industry as a whole.

Stormgate had potential, but it's been squandered. I won't be wasting any more time or money on this game.  Avoid it at all costs.

Pros:

None.
Cons:

Unfinished and unpolished
Poorly balanced gameplay
Predatory monetization
Disrespectful to players
Damages the industry

Stay away. Don't support this kind of Early Access abuse.

steam,172271482,"As a longtime Starcraft 2 player and an avid RTS fan i had high expectations for this game which is supposed to be the spiritual successor to the Starcraft series. In the state the game is in right now, I sadly have been very disappointed. It feels clunky, slow and feels more like Warcraft 3 than Starcraft 2. It feels like the people at Frost Giant tried a little bit too hard to make it resemble the Blizzard RTS games and just fused too many things together that aren't necessary. 

Right now the UI is misplacing too much crucial information and the control of units doesn't feel smooth.
The quality of the game is good, but many aspects just aren't on par with some of the older games, which are already more than 14 years old. I give some benefit of the doubt, as it is in early access and I would love to see improvements. The storywriting feels very cliche, cheesy and recycled and doesn't sell the ""epic"" it's trying to be, again, I think they tried too hard to resemble the old Blizzard but along the way, they somehow lost their way. It feels like they really put their emphasis on the ""competitive, E-Sports side"" and started to neglect the other parts of the game. 

The monetizing model is also sad, as you need to pay for each campaign pack seperately and the microtransactions don't stop there. There is already too many things you ""can buy"". The project has already been funded hugely on kickstarter, so I am disappointed that they chose to go for this kind of monetization model that made me look for alternatives to Blizzard games in the first place. 

I would have loved to see major changes and bigger differences but the way it is right now, Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 in their own field are far more superior and it still feels like a far shot for Stormgate to reach that level.",1723839469,2024-08-16 16:17:49
steam,172270644,"this is my opinion on what i have seen on the game...

Point 1 - F2P, how they handle it
Their decitions for the Monetization are fine... selling campaing champeters and heroes for Co-Op, Pluss skins is fine. its what SC2 does and they leave the Competitive strategy Free so you can play the RTS part for free and are only force to pay for Story Chapters and Commanders[Heros] for Co-Op
there is no P2W feature on the game, the most annoying is that unless you pay, your only going to be able to play Co-Op as a Human, wich honestly rather bad... even SC2 had 1 commander of each faction for free, the devs should really consider releasing the other 2 commanders for free as well after having 1 commander of each faction for free they can start charging for additional commanders that i have no issue with.

Point 2 - Gameplay!
The gameplay, each faction is really unique and weird when compared with each other and they do have some interesting ideas with them, i can tell they put a lot of effort into them and for that i do personally like them, can't say i have an extense knowledge of each one because they are so diferent from each other and they all have the Commander style bar of faction abilitys like in SC2 co-op but in vanilla RTS i do recomend using the AI when you start atleast to make the AI do the workers and resource gathering for you.

-this game haves an AI bot helping you play???
there is even a function to have a AI Bot help you while you play, to reduce the load of things you must do it can handle the creation of workers and supply lines on his own so you can focus on the RTS aspect of it, whats more you can cuztomise how much help do you want, in my time playing i only used the ""make workers and put them to get resources"" i prefer to build my own buildings and Combat units so i disable that from the AI 


Point 3 - NOW THE HORRIBLE REALITY
the art style is the worst i have ever seen on a game, it certenly haves work put into it its nothing that a child could have done on his own but the direction of this artstyle is just awfull, i mean i legit strugle to want to play the game more just because i cannot stand this artstyle they are going for... i know they have focus on clarity and that may have something to do for what they did but i legit cannot stand it, i only have 1.2 hours on the game because i just couldn't stand this art style.. im not even joking... i was really excited for the Co-Op mode myself loving to play to this day the SC2 Co-Op or the arcade, but really if the art of the game is so bad that it turns you off no matter how much value you see on the other aspects i cannot push myself to play it... this being the only Negative point on my review is also the reason for why i vote NO do not play this game, the devs expended lots of time doing this game and i can see it... but they need to fix this issue because is not only Me issue is something you can see in the Disscusions of the game the artsytle is just that awfull, go play any other RTS o play SC2, even W3 reforged had better art then this....

6 maps and 5 commanders, 4 of them free to lvl up to lvl 5 for co op.
Campaign is not worth it right now.
Matchmaking is quick currently.

While most things feel borrowed, there are cool things and remixes of different old ideas:
Celestials have huge Archangels as T3 flying unit which slap enemy ships in melee and can dive onto ground.

It's free and it it should get even better once more co op content, custom maps and campaign polish get added.

steam,172269460,"Okay so THAT update was really a tentative middle-vote. But time has gone on and the early-access-and-free kiddie gloves are coming fully off. I don't hate the game or anything but I simply don't, generally, think it's worth your time or money.

There was a big update so here is my updated review:
I wish Steam would let you leave a neutral review, but it's free so a positive review really means ""You might as well check it out"".
-Most crucially, the game has been optimised, and now runs in line with what I expect from my hardware.
-I don't care for the slow combat, but that's just preference.
-I also don't vibe with all of the changes to the character design and narrative, but it is a definite improvement.

And below is my old, negative review for like, archival I guess. Just shows that the game is coming along. Thanks to the devs for keeping at it.

It is free and in early access but they are offering DLC for sale so I no longer consider those valid defences against the negative review:
-Massive performance issues, particularly in co-op once there are a lot of units, micro just goes out the window and you just blob around and hope for the best while watching the slideshow.
-Mission 3 of the campaign simply will not load for me. Literally unplayable.
-Some UI tooltips appear under the cursor (and move with it) so you can't read them.
-A lot of in-game information on unit stats is just vague enough to be annoying.
-Custom games don't even let you 3v1
-The character design does not leave me feeling excited

I do like the unique faction mechanics (and I'm not worried aboot balance at this point), and can still be optimistic that the engine will allow for cool custom games as promised.",1723837350,2024-08-16 15:42:30

steam,172269009,"This game really could have used some more time before release to the public. It is very rough around the edges, lacking many features that one would expect from the 'spiritual' successor to StarCraft 2. I think a lot of the negative reviews right now revolve around the campaign and I cannot blame them, as the cut scenes really are brutal. That being said, I am giving this game a positive review because I believe the core game play mechanics of this game are fantastic, and this game still has a lot of promise. The game clearly has a long way to go, but I have not had this much fun with 1v1 in an RTS in a very long time. I hope the Dev's listen to the criticism they are receiving, and turn this game into what we all hoped, and what I believe it can be.",1723836883,2024-08-16 15:34:43
steam,172268919,"Updating my review for the release coming from an early access purchaser. What a HUGE mistake that was. 

Decided, ""hey it's so-called full release is out so lets give it a go."" In short: I wasted my drive space and my time downloading this terrible game.

Pay to play campaign!? Either make it a F2P game or make it a 1-time purchase. Don't gatekeep parts of your game. Do they have no community input on this? Are they putting ideas in a hat and then blindly pulling one out and going for it? I haven't ever seen a team make so many consistently bad ideas / mistakes back to back to back. I guess you get a little cash in your pocket and lose all semblance of intelligent thought then scramble because you wasted said money.

Frankly, excited there are so many other RTS games out or coming out of soon (The Scouring, Coloniser, Immortal: Gates of Pyre, ZeroSpace, Tempest Rising, Age of Mythology: Retold, Godsworn) because Stormgate will fall by the wayside and for good reason. This game does everything in the RTS genre worse than almost every other title that is still in development.

TLDR; Every part of this game is 0.6. Call it what it is. 

Half-baked. PUT IT BACK IN THE OVEN!",1723836763,2024-08-16 15:32:43
steam,172268873,"I am having a lot of fun in the multiplayer 1v1 mode. Despite what most people say, I think that Stormgate is much closer to the Warcraft 3 than Starcraft 2 in terms of pacing, which is definitely not a bad thing, just something to be aware of if you are looking for more high-risk-high-reward micro-intensive Starcraft-like experience. What I especially like is the bigger, more strategic role of the map in obtaining a victory and interactions with it through creep camps or destructible environment. Also, animations of the effects like explosions are really nicely made (Infernals!), light reflections looks great and modern, terrain textures looks good if you like stylized, illustration like graphics (reminds me a little bit of Dishonored); the rest of the graphics are not as bad as people says, but they require re-coloring to make some units more distinguishable it the heat of battle. Gameplay is really smooth and responsive, no latency or hiccups while playing on the ladder.

I highly recommend you giving it a shot if you are a fan of the RTS genre. 

Besides that, some game elements such as interface and campaign require substantial improvement, but seeing how much progress Frost Giant developers made and how they communicate and receive feedback from players and tester, I have high hopes that they will succeed in improving the game and delivering new, fresh and engaging RTS experience.

The only thing that worries me is the monetization strategy. The current prices seem a lot too much for what there is to be offered (especially during Early Access), so if you want to buy anything don't expect much and treat it as a way to support the developers if anything else.",1723836711,2024-08-16 15:31:51

I set a new world record speed run for losing interest in a new game. 

Dumb UI decisions
- worker selection algorithm is not intuitive and makes no sense
- can't set hotkeys for specific UI actions, only grid location
- no customization for modifier keys
- can't save games in single player.

Control feels terrible
- spastic/snappy instant turn rates
- no real gameplay beyond basic stutter step micro

Story [campaign] is bad ([spoilers]? but not really because you see it coming a mile away)
- main character utterly unlikable, acts like she hates all of her friends to appear ""strong"", but is just huge asshole
- ""Kerrigan/Arthas at home"" storyline. Ttalking evil sword turns good guy bad, girl character is transformed to the ugly creatures against her will
- Mission objectives make no sense. ""find cattle"" but its just an item you pick up? 
- No progression with mission design or objectives. Usually in RTS there's a gradual introduction to mechanics, but you're constantly finding items that you can't use/haven't been told what to do with, making mission's feel stilted and improperly paced

steam,172262425,"Post 0.4, the answer to this game is yesn't, but steam doesn't have that option.

The game has improved quite a bit. Mainly the campaign seem a lot more interesting, it's a complete rewrite of the first missions, still half of it (3 missions) is behind a 10 euro paywall. Would I recommend paying for it, no, it's not complete.

Units feel much better now. They feel more responsive and don't feel like that much bullet sponges anymore.

The performance though, is still crap. Can barely keep 60 on early game 1v1 on low settings. Specs: 6 core i7-9th gen with RTX 2060 and 32GB ram. It's not the most up to date hardware, but I it's not weak either. Besides, shit is expensive now a days.

I did heard one of the lead people say that this is an actual ""early access"" game, which given what they have done makes sense, there are some drastic changes. But that doesn't give a free pass on the pricing of stuff, like why the heck is 3 missions of the campaign behind a paywall? I would understand if it was the entire finished campaign, but cmon now. I ain't paying for testing your game.

steam,172262405,"It's not worth your time currently and most likely never will be.

I noticed Stormgate, when it was being hyped up to be the next Starcraft / Warcraft RTS. I think that the hype was mostly wishful thinking from RTS players who are disappointed with Blizzard's neglect of SC2 and the failure of making a good game out of Warcraft III: Reforged (while nuking the original Warcraft III on battlenet). So understandably people are hoping for a spiritual successor.

Stormgate isn't it. The campaign is so bad it drags the entire game down with it and makes me want to avoid it completely. I played the first 3 missions free and watched the rest on youtube. Glad I didn't pay. It's not ""rough around the edges"", it's an unsalvageable trainwreck. It's bland cringe with an unlikable main character, trash writing, world building and story, poor voice acting, bad mission design and an awful artstyle. There is simply no way that it can get close to being the next good RTS, unless they redo all of that. It's a shame because the actual 1v1 mode is not bad, but not enough on its own. From what I've seen so far, I don't believe Frost Giant has the energy, talent and money they would need to make it good. The Quickmacro feature is nice, but such a small improvement, it's basically irrelevant.

One thing I found especially annoying and haven't seen mentioned anywhere yet is that the game never explains to you that Therium is a resource that replenishes over time and 5 workers are the ideal amount on a patch, so that it never depletes. Why is that not mentioned or indicated anywhere? It's such a trap for new players who try to figure the game out themselves, rather than look up guides online because you can send an infinite amount of workers to quickly deplete the Therium and ruin your economy. This little piece of knowledge is the difference between playing a good game and getting stomped by someone who knows this in 1v1. It's so annoying to have the game pretend to be ""noob-friendly"" with it's intuitive Quickmacro feature and then stab you in the back with the hidden detail on how Therium works. The only way I got to know this is by clicking the ""learn to play"" button in the main menu and watching an intro Youtube video. The game should somehow teach you this in the first mission and the UI should indicate something.
 
Frost Giant spent their $40 million budget on creating a worse game than what we had over 10 years ago. The CEO/founders probably made more money than expected, so their goals are met. The game feels like it's a calculated attempt to make the bare minimum viable product to not get sued, by implementing enough microtransactions to pay back investors. You can tell by the lack of detail that no one in charge really cares about it and it will probably never be anything great. Basically Stormgate feels like a lame attempt to milk the starving RTS crowd.

The only faint shimmer of hope for Stormgate is that I'm completely wrong about everything and Frost Giant pulls a 360.
But that's some serious Copium and looks impossible to me.

---

To end this review on something more positive, I will leave some other recommendations for RTS players.
I'm currently playing Iron Harvest which is on sale now for $5 and a good game for the price.

 Some upcoming RTS games that look promising:
- Tempest Rising
- Immortal: Gates of Pyre
- Battle Aces

The classics:
- Warcraft III (original, not reforged - you can still play it in multiplayer via WC3Connect or GameRanger)
- Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance
- Command & Conquer Remastered (surprisingly not a bad remake)

As a final note: Starcraft II is still the best RTS overall, even after more than a decade since release. Sadly it won't be developed further. I agree with other reviews that all Stormgate really does is make me want to play more SC2 (so I can forget that Stormgate exists). I think it's fair to be savage with Stormgate for the horrendous microtransactions that the game already has, despite being a tasteless nothingburger.",1723829991,2024-08-16 13:39:51

You cannot make the bold claim that you are going to develop a game on that level and then show up with Stormgate in its current state. This game as of right now is underwhelming and under-delivered / under-developed. Some of the audio effects feel like placeholders. Audio overall is a bit random and doesn't feel coherent, doesn't help me get immersed. Visual effects are bad as well. The voice acting of the units is underwhelming.

This is a playable RTS as it is, however compared to the leading titles in the genre, this game has no chance to stand out whatsoever in its current state. Can it be improved? Perhaps. But it has such a long way to go, it is hard for me to imagine that it will be up to par with WC3 / SC2 at some point.

The units are lacking a distinct feel. For example - I can ""feel"" the unit in SC2 - a marine, a tank, a zealot, a carrier, a hydralisk. They all have epic voice acting, stunning visuals and amazing audio and visual effects when fighting/ dieing. Units in SC2 feel amazing to use in every situation and are an eye candy to look at. SC2 feels so smooth and the music/ maps/ buildings /units create a destinct atmosphere that I can immerse myself into easily and with pleasure. Stormgate on the other hand fails to create a coherent universe at this point. The buildings in it look like they are made out of plastic. The art overall is mediocre at best!

I get that it is free to play but 5 heroes and only one is free... you have to shell out 9.99 for just 1 hero and then 9.99 for missions. We are at full price game with just the starting stuff.

Add to that that the offering is WORSE than a full price game. They say they will fix wonky models and stuff like that, I believe them, but prices also need fixing.

They are aping sc2 and wc3 which I am fine with. But when they offer compared to those games is nothing. sc2 gave a full campagin, wc3 gave you 4. Sc added the co-op mode with 3 free characters.

steam,172251308,"I only had to do the first campaign mission and that was enough.

I'll come out and say right away what the deal breakers are.... you have to ""log in"" to their system to access the menu. That means this game is always online even if you just want to enjoy a singleplayer map/campaign mission. First screen you see is ""Log in with Steam"" or ""Quit"" as your only options before you're allowed to access anything else, including settings. Free 2 Play with a singleplayer component that still requires you to ""check in"" online just to access it.

The campaign is paywalled too. You only have access to the free ""prologue"" missions, which isn't the actual ""game"", it's just slow bleed intro-to-a-mechanic type story missions. But even if you were to own the campaign content, you won't have access to it unless you are online... to play a singleplayer campaign... you have to be online... is this the kind of standard for game design you want to encourage?

And like others have mentioned, this game will really make you want to go play Starcraft 2 or Warcraft 3 again because this feels like a severely watered down version of the two.

To be more specific, this game has simplified the classic Blizzard RTS formula. It looks to have the hero focus and general fantasy map-layout and ""orc"" vibe of Warcraft 3 with the pseudo ""they're not Space Marines"" tech of Starcraft, all presented with the cutesy child-friendly art stylings of Overwatch.

Mass PvP multiplayer matches actually sounds really cool, but anyone that seriously would appreciate that is also thinking of the kind of versatility that you would get from the proper Blizzard games, and not a watered down version of those mechanics and systems.

The fundamental efforts of the devs looks to be decent at a glance, but this game's design clearly includes many wrong choices in what it is trying to evolve from the Blizzard games. It appears to have simplified things by dumbing them down, rather than making tedious tasks more efficient to deal with.

The art style is also somewhat unnerving. The in-game characters have unusually huge eyes which gives them a kind of lifeless-puppet quality to them. It's a strong contrast to the pre-rendered cutscenes. The lifelessness is also reflected in the voice acting, which is incredibly dull. You'll get more emotion from a narrator on an audiobook about 'murikan biological warfare conducted during WW2. To be fair to the voice actors, the script here does not give them much to work with anyway.

Think of all of the generic tropey trash on Steam these days because someone thought ""we can make money from releasing a mediocre and formulaic  game with cute graphics""... basically everything from Chinese churn-devs like TinyBuild and such with their ultra family-friendly bland stories... that's what this is.

Blandcraft.

The female character, Amara I believe her name was, has that creepy ultra plastic surgery look that is so popular with the Gen Z'ers that are addicted to TikTok and OnlyFans. The male characters are stylised sure, but Amara stands out as going beyond stylised. It's all of those little details that eat away at the sense of cohesion behind this game... and then you witness the mini-cutscene in the first prologue mission with the orc creature that is speaking with the identical grunt-tones and linguistic skills of the orcs from Warcraft... like a carbon copy of a voice from Warcraft 3... it's the proverbial straw that quickly broke the camel's back.

Even if you put the bland story, the blatant hybridised copying of so many Blizzard visual/thematic elements and the strange cutesy art aside, remember:
  ALWAYS ONLINE
  PAYWALL SINGLEPLAYER CAMPAIGN
  PLANS TO MICRO-$$$ EVERYTHING

steam,172251245,"kinda feels like im just playing an sc2 skin but with some lame decisions

main gripes:
-zerg clone race has really boring/uninteresting creep mechanic called ""shroud"", but instead of managing creep tumors/queens, you just.. place it right away.. also the output for ""shroud"" is just a really boring extra hp bloat, no fun speed or anything interesting to play with.
-they have the larvae mechanic from zerg but it's tied to every building, capping at 3, but weirdly they made the units just spawn in super fast when you press it, skipping any timers?
-art style/direction just is kind of cartoonish and hard to take serious, the terrain/areas are overall nice and pretty but the model designs bother me (ik they addressed this already)
-design choice conflicts, eg: demon race for some reason is just also zombie / infestation themed? why am i making sacrificial altars and literally watching imps sacrifice themselves to become structures, but then i have this weird ""zombie"" queen that ""infects"" enemies, stick with the cool ass ashen hellfire theme i dont want some lame zombie in my demon army lol
-the objectives are a cute idea but they are kind of lamely implemented, should be something you and your opponent compete over, not some ""map control"" reward

idk, it's early access but first impressions matter, and i just felt disappointed that there was a lack of creativity and imagination, i dont think it helped that a lot of things felt /way/ too familiar to sc2, to the point that the SCV-like workers have almost the exact same dialogue, ""in the rear with the gear"" ""what you need somethin?"" like ???

that being said there are some positives to the game, such as the multiple modes and catering to that audience of players who like to play with friends or play co-op campaign etc. some of the units are both interesting in their abilities and their design despite the art style/direction, and honestly the imp guys are cute and i love them ngl

uhh idk this feels like im writing more feedback than a review but i hope my post is helpful somewhat, i just felt a bit disappointed with how i've been looking forward to this since i first saw it announced.
but there's still potential :)",1723818913,2024-08-16 10:35:13

You can only play with heroes in PVE, but not even custom games.

They lock every hero behind a paywall.

They even lock things behind another paywall from their ultimate pack supporters, while there's not much to offer.

The game is dead, the max player count in a week barely exceeds a hundred, devs probably don't even care about that.

If you are planning to buy things in this game, don't, look what they are doing to the early access supporters. (basically EA supporters pay more and get even less)

They are even screwing and milking the only players left. They just want money.

Some of the models and voice acting are shockingly bad. No facial animation whatsover at this current stage. The art style is plain not good looking but bearable. The story is obviously setting up to be a Warcraft 3 rip-off. The gameplay is standart RTS, similar to SC2. Not bad but when everything else is at this level it's hard to pick it over SC2. The best part about it is surprisingly the intro cinematic which is actually Blizzard quality or nearly there.

Give it time, wait and see. I will try it again after 1.0, or when I hear things are coming together.

UPDATE: They released from early access, it's not 1.0 yet but at this point I doubt it's getting there. I came back and gave the campaign a shot, the graphics are still meh.

steam,172247309,"TLDR: 3/10 overall. A solid 8/10 if this game came out in 2010.

This game is in a rough, rough state. I understand it's early access, but it absolutely should not be available to the public in any capacity right now. The voice acting is atrocious and should be completely redone, the cutscenes are abysmal, and the main character is detestable. Additionally, it's not possible to kite with the main character because the attack animation is too long. You also can't attack enemies who are running away from you at max range for the same reason. Unit pathing is horrible, and when units stop moving they constantly form an immovable wall, making it impossible to micro damaged frontline units out of the fight. Also, this game blatantly steals Starcraft voice lines, which is sad because is looks and plays so much worse than a game 10+ years its senior.",1723815018,2024-08-16 09:30:18

steam,172245645,"As a Starcraft II 1v1 player, I am very happy with Stormgate so far. The QWERT system for macro is a HUGE quality of life improvement in my opinion and the main innovative feature of the game. This system has removed the necessity to hotkey buildings, putting all your macro in one convenient spot automatically and freeing up your hotkeys for micro. Veteran players who are used to hotkeys or want the game to be as complex as possible may not find this useful, but I think a lot of new players who take the time to engage with the game and learn how this QWERT system works will find macro much more intuitive now than it ever used to be. Matchmaking so far in the first few days has found me similarly skilled opponents pretty well, and quickly.
I've played co-op with my friends a bit as well. The heroes seem to be free up through level 5 and in a few days of playing so far we are still only level 2. I have spent no money on the game yet and I think $10 min if you are a long term co-op player is pretty reasonable.
My main complaints so far are that the stats are very bare bones. There are few maps. I wish there was online 3v3 ladder but I assume they are trying not to fragment the player base too much at the start. Following the game from when it was announced, I was always underwhelmed by the graphics in the trailers. But I think they heard the feedback at those stages and the graphics now look more polished and aesthetically pleasing and have not bothered me at all in the actual game.
There is the background situation where the budget for the game seems to have ballooned and they have only delivered early access when fans expected a full game from initial backing, and some criticism of that is fair. But to be honest I am finding the game extremely fun and the 1v1 experience to me feels complete and it is completely free to play. Hard to argue with that.",1723813283,2024-08-16 09:01:23

steam,172243985,"Not great and a bit misleading.

Stormgate is free to play, but has the exact business model of starcraft 2: only multiplayer is free to play, and even then, the co-op is not free to play in its entirety - you have to purchase individual heroes for use. In addition to that, the campaign is not free to play, only what amounts to a tutorial for the human faction is free to play (and even then, the tutorial is not very good at teaching what does what - it relies on you knowing how RTS games work)

As for it being next-gen, I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean. I've played the free tutorial campaign (3 missions) and two vs ai games - there is nothing new or different from other RTS. Units have a veterancy system similar to Red Alert, there are two resources to gather similar to starcraft, the human faction plays like a mix between red alert and starcraft , the demon faction plays like zerg from starcraft, the angel faction plays like a mix between protoss from starcraft and eldar from WH40k DoW. There is a top bar with abilities like in starcraft 2 protoss campaign and WH40k DoW Soulstorm's dark eldar, defensive structures are a mix between warcraft 3 and red alert - it's not really doing anything new as much as combining aspects from different past RTS games. I'm really confused as to what ""next gen"" is supposed to mean - everything I've seen has been done before, and not even the graphics are particularly unique or appealing.

The gameplay is stock standard, just take your units and attack. Suffers from the same pitfalls as other RTS such as units not moving in formation according to their roles, so melee units can end up in the back while your fragile ranged units go to the front. The only quality of life feature in the game seems to be the fact that you can have an AI companion do your macro-ing for you, which removes about 50% of the gameplay from the game.

The multiplayer maps are also stock standard, with ""creep"" enemies guarding important things you may want (like in warcraft 3) and who you can (presumably?) farm for veterancy. Veterancy does not however seem to be a thing for Infernals and Angels, so that may make the maps slightly imbalanced in favor of humans, as the veterancy bonus showcased in the campaign gives quite a lot of bonuses.

As it stands I don't recommend it. If the finished product delivers on at least being ""next gen"" and brings something unique to the scene, sure, I'll change my review, otherwise I don't see a reason to pick this game over the games it takes inspiration from, except for it being something different - which is the same argument one can use to start playing red alert or tiberian sun instead.

Overall negative impression of the game for now. Hope that changes when it's fully released.",1723811408,2024-08-16 08:30:08

I couldn't find any intel on the macro making like starcraft2 so i could group them on command and macro kite the enemy . Also you cannot place them in groups there is no option of it so you have to individually select and position .

steam,172242028,"Honestly just makes me want to play Starcraft 2 again. It's still too early of a release, hopefully with time it will come into it's own. It feels more like Warcraft 3 than Starcraft, except it doesn't have heroes in skirmishes, removing what made Warcraft 3 feel so unique and good. Units are tankier than you'd expect, along with buildings. Creep camps have a purpose, but just feel weird, and tech's take forever to research. At the end of the day, it feels like a cheap knock off of a blizzard product.  They'll need to innovate more if they want to compete with the inevitable return of Blizzard to the genre. It simply isn't refined enough in any department, and does almost nothing new to hold an audience. I'm a full supporter of indie companies trying to bring back the RTS genre, but this one just aint hitting it right for the subgenre of Blizzard RTS.

If you're a fan of the genre, and more specifically Blizzard style RTS games, it's worth a download since it's free. I just don't recommend spending money, unless you really want to support the developers and hope this game will come into it's own.",1723809147,2024-08-16 07:52:27
steam,172241763,"A clone of Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3, like a War3 custom map made by fans. The game is unfinished, in ""Early Access"". The problem with Stormgate is that the developers, despite having asked millions of dollars from their future players, do not prioritize their updates well, so they put the whole project at risk of being terminated.

There is a 20min campaign, a co-op mode, a 1v1 ladder, and custom mode to play 1v1 and 2v2.

What they could do immediately to try to save the game, is fix anything that can be fixed asap, by releasing small updates 2 times per week, to show that they respect their players, instead of talking of what they may do next months or next years.

1. Fix the obvious bugs

- When money is asked from players, before and during the release, the game is released. There is no ""EA"" excuse anymore to not do anything as fast as possible
- Any bug that can be fixed today shoud be fixed today (bottom right map scrolling not working, units stuck in mountains, ...)
- In co-op, units are showing potential upgrades that they do not have in this mode (example: Gaunts)

2. Low hanging fruits, should have been released yesterday already

- Create a 2v2 matchmaking immediately, no one is going to custom mode and players just want to give up the game because of this
- Team chat: 3 lines of code, go go go
- Lobby chat: even simple at beginning
- Make solo vs 3 AI possible in custom mode
- When a player leaves in co-op, do something better than now: either destroy all his buildings, or give player control of their army, or anything else - now we need to destroy their base and we don't really see that they are gone

3. Foundations

- Improve pathfinding
- Reduce lag, improve performance, step by step
- Too many disconnects
- Better AI in custom mode, so players can play solo vs AI. Temporary solution: just make an AI that earns x2 gold, so at least there is a challenge

4. UI & UX

- UI unit info: when we select a unit, just copy the UI of successful games to present the information for now. Currently too much mouseover is needed, and too many informations are missing on the units. Fix what you can today, then some more on Monday, etc., and release improvements all the time
- Remove the ""Ready"" checkbox in custom mode
- Improve Observers/Replay step by step at each update, too many informations are missing
- Co-op selection screen UI clarity
- Display proper information in 2v2 custom mode during game loading screen, currently it's showing only 2 players instead of 4
- Loading screen custom mode: do not show the faction of the ""random"" faction players, show them as random
- Co-op loading screen: display difficulty under the map title
- Co-op: We don't see gear before having a hero at level 11, it's not satisfying for the players
- In design, we generally do not put a text in bold or change its letter-spacing on mouseover, it's clunky (see for example Tabs ""Overview, Unlocks, Gear, Cosmetics"" in co-op)

5. Monetization

- I would buy things if the devs were communicating properly and fixing things all the time, but they don't, so we have no trust and don't want to buy anything from them.
- Heroes in coop could cost 5$, not 10$ as there is not much to do in co-op for now.
- The 20min campaign, honnestly, is not what will make players stay for now. Improve 1v1, implement 2v2, improve co-op, it's what we have for now, work with what you have, not what you could have

6. Progression

- The only progression we have for now is in co-op. Some rewards do not make sense. Review the rewards to improve the satisfaction of leveling up so players are more eager to buy heroes
- Gear: all 5 heroes unlock a gear at lvl 11, then 2 heroes unlocks a gear at lvl 12, then 2 heroes unlocks a gear at lvl 15, this could be improved right now
- Find something easy to implement right now for players above lvl 15 in co-op

7. Balance

- Continue to release 2 patches per week for small balance changes and overall improvements
- Vanguards Dogs problem
- See community feedback about balance
- Celestials has almost only 1 unit: Argent
- Celestials tanks are too slow to be fun, their speed skill does not make for it
- Same for Infernals big dog: having to manage very slow units all the time is not satisfying at all

8. Design

- Improve 1 or 2 visual models at each release
- Infernal's Brutes are too big for low HP, it does not make sense, experiment to improve this kind of perception issue
- Tanks don't feel satisfying enough

Hope this game becomes better with time. Giving a thumbs up for encouragement, but if they don't start to patch the game at least 1-2 times per week, I'm afraid everyone will uninstall and never come back.",1723808790,2024-08-16 07:46:30

steam,172241194,"Definitely bad af!
Almost nothing good about that project, expect maybe genre.
Obviously current stage is early access so I won't focus on bugs/crashes/optimization and similar stuff but there's much worst problems that's can't be solved and I'll prove it you, that's game is deadborn.

Graphic stylistic is on the level of Fortnite, or worse. Any video games created in '00s has much greatest visual than it.A terrains, models, UI with ultra-huge ugly buttons and some characters, that feels like money-supported by Blackrock.

Nothing is original, every single thing is taken from others RTS. So we got a Frankenstein that's woven from:
- SC2 (whole theme, visual ((but much worse)), races, buildings, many units)
- Warcraft 3 (Heroes with abils, jungle camps)
- AoE 4 (forests for ambushes) 
And maybe something else, idc anymore, that's enough for me.

Game is ulta-raw to enjoy, there's no high-tier (endgame) much units, not all race abilities added, absolutely unbalanced in PvP (Angels OP, Terrans is trash, Infernals - average) and unfinished company with ugly cinematics that can crash your OS on the 2nd chapter.

Conclusion: The game will never restore the RTS genre. Why?
- The genre is not dead, any b-net RTS or AoE games is still playable, tournaments is exists, ladder viable, servers - online. If this online/community is not high for you - you're dumb or just normie, just go to play Dota, do not watch at this side.
- Stormgate will never reach SC2 popularity for many reasons, at least the the base is already failed. Unreal Engine 5 is garbage, stylistic of buildings and units no one will ever change (that's love maybe only kids from phone games).
So if you looking for a new RTS to play - check for remake of Age of Mythology, it will release in 2-3 weeks, much perspective than it.",1723808086,2024-08-16 07:34:46

steam,172237518,Campaign dialogue and theming is akin to a bad rendition of a Red-Alert skit and Marvel dialogue. Unit themes and designs are interesting but that's about it when it comes to the factions. Units don't feel strong or powerful but maybe due to the games focus on competitive pvp combat like Starcraft and Warcraft.

steam,172236984,"While it is still in Development, Some sounds need more punch to it, visuals are little silly at times, this game has the potential to reignite the fire that is the Real Time Strategy Games.

Now to wait for units so big, they need to be built on the field,and it's a golden game.",1723802770,2024-08-16 06:06:10
steam,172235311,"Aside from other stuff folks mentioned, like awful sound design (low effort voicelines, inconsistent volume between lines, few lines per unit so they repeat very often, they cut each other off instead of overlapping so shift-queueing a bunch of buildings results in STRU-STRU-STRU-STRUCTURE COMPLETE), a very poor campaign (I've only played the free missions, but I was irked by the first mission being a bargain bin rehash of WC3's Human 1, down to the cutscenes) and questionable balance choices (it takes watching the game for an hour to see Celestials doing 0:00 rushes because their free unit is a flier that can attack workers), I'd like to add with two points in particular.

One major issue that actively ruins the experience is pathing issues. The units are incredibly stupid, seemingly lacking the ability to re-calculate pathing once their initial route is blocked by units or buildings, so instead of recalculating another path, they usually end up just standing there, often still playing their running animation. This problem is especially pronounced on melee units who naturally bump into a lot of things en route to hitting something and in situations where there's allied units in the way, who stand there like a brick wall and your units lose their sh*t trying to get past them. It makes micro a chore, especially in PvE scenarios where you have three players moving their blobs around the same area and they crash into each other like bricks and can't maneuver properly.

Speaking of coop, since it's my preferred mode in SC2 and the one I looked forward to the most in SG, most of the missions feel a little uninspired, such as the ones that involve killing gates within a time, the bonus objectives are routinely recycled, such as ""kill big man over there"" or ""kill bases that you were going to anyway since they spawn attack waves"". Ironically, the one mission I liked conceptually quite a bit, one that involves convoys travelling to the enemy base that you need to stop, had us soft-locking the mission where it wouldn't register the main objective completing so we had to quit out. 

I think there are enough bones here to make a presentable product eventually, but currently, unless you're a pretty passionate player who wants to test Frost Giant's game, I think you should pass on the game, SC2 is a far superior product for virtually every category of gamer, whether it's campaign players, coop players or PVP players.",1723800535,2024-08-16 05:28:55

The first thing that caught my eye, as a veteran of Warcraft 3 and both Starcrafts, is the first mission we have to play, brought alive from the aforementioned productions. The main character is a copy of Maiev, a location like the first mission of The Frozen Throne Sentinel campaign, where we follow the trail of Illidan. The ""well of life"", where we can use teleportation just above the waterfall, just like in this mission. The scene with the people brought by the prison convoy (led by a demon looking like a Warcraft ogre) was so heavily drawn that I was just waiting for the movie break with the boy saying ""What happened to the others who were taken away by Demons?"" The Warcraft player, will know what it is (the first mission of the People in the Regin of Chaos campaign). In my opinion, the jump on the money, nothing creative, nothing new, is bad for me, because as a fan of both universes, I would like it to be something new, not a redrawn Warcraft in a world similar to Starcraft.

Pierwsze co rzuciło mi się w oczy, jako weteranowi Warcrafta 3 i obu Starcraftów, to pierwsza misja jaką mamy do zagrania, żywcem ściągnięta z wyżej wymienionych produkcji. Główna bohaterka to wypisz wymaluj Maiev, lokacja jest podobna do tej z pierwszej misji The Frozen Throne kampani Sentinel, gdzie idziemy śladem Illidana. Mocno w oczy rzuca się ""studnia życia"", przy której jest nawet miejsce do skorzystania z teleportacji tuż nad wodospadem, co miało też miejsce w wyżej wymienionej misji. Scena z wywożonymi przez konwój więzienny ludźmi (swoją drogą dowodzonymi przez demona którego można śmiało nazwać ogrem z Warcrafta) była tak mocno przerysowana, że czekałem tylko na przerywnik filmowy z chłopcem mówiącym ""A co z tymi których porwały demony?"" Kto grał w Warcrafta, będzie wiedział o co chodzi (pierwsza misja kampanii Ludzi w Regin of Chaos). Moim zdaniem skok na kasę, nic kreatywnego, nic nowego, źle mi się na to patrzy, ponieważ jako fan obu uniwersów, chciałbym by było to coś nowego, a nie przerysowany Warcraft w świecie zbliżonym do Starcrafta.

steam,172223947,"Let me sum this game up in one word: Boring. 

Imagine everything from Starcraft one, but slowed to the point where moving one unit is more interesting than any type of fight, if only for the fact that you get to laugh at the bad model with a bad animation. 

Gameplay: 
Abysmally slow and boring as hell. I honestly don't know why they did this. Most RTS games have some sort of counter situation for units. Starcraft has many counters! Siege tanks counter basic Infantry. Air units counter siege tanks. This game has been toned down so much for first time ever RTS players that there is literally none of this. Didn't you love that oomph that a Baneling had when it hit your opponent's infantry? That sizzle that came with it that told you 'that man is very dead now'? Congratulations, that's been replaced with explosives that barely dent the armor of your workers. Now, what about those Warcraft features? Stuff like creep camps and such. Well, you have a healing well, energy well, and vision over a massive area. Such intuitive and unique gameplay. (Not to mension the fact that the AI in this game might as well be non-existent, unironically.)

Sound and Graphics: 
The sound is again, really boring. The graphics need to be wholly redone if they want to even begin to compete with modern games. Voice lines are flat and repetitive. Gun shots? Flat and repetitive. Stabbing someone? Flat and repetitive. Graphics? Flat and repetitive.

Now, what do I think this all stems from? Those cocky and egotistical devs at Blizzard, who can't do anything wrong ever. If you say so, they'll sue or something idk. Let's be honest, this stems from them almost solely. A terrible monetization that mocks Overwatch 2's 20 USD Skins, hell even mocks some of the stuff EA has done. 

What are you getting with this game by the Starcraft 2 developers, with absolutely no other features, as shown with most of their advertising? A bland and boring game, that they're hoping to cover up OMG IS THAT A STARCRAFT DEVELOPER????? BEST GAME EVER!!!!! 

Plus, they're repeating the mistakes of the past, by shoving a competitive scene on a game that literally hasn't ''''''''''''fully'''''''''''' released for another year, down your throat! Combine that with the best faction being the one that lets you place one well hidden production structure like 40 miles away from your base and 2 feet next to your opponent's base, and the fact that whoever throws more units at the issue first wins automatically with no real counterplay other than shove 200000 more units at the enemy, because all oomph that a unit might've had has been replaced with bland unit have projectile or melee weapon!",1723783158,2024-08-16 00:39:18

But though, there is a few things i don't like about, which i must address the elephant in the room, which is the free-to-play for it, though i do admit that they add things to make it practical, so that is just personal reference. next is the lack of content, though that is indeed expanding. and finally, it needs more background information in the codex, which will also expand with time, so just also personal note from myself.

steam,172221786,"Stormgate fails as the ""spiritual successor"" I feel we needed it to be.

We are further away from the SC 2 Beta / launch, than the years between Brood War and SC2.  
I played SC since the Broodwar launch.  Played some Age of Empires to change the flavor. 
Still have my SC2 Beta Test Code inside my SC2 box.

• The idea is to bring new players to RTS and the e-sport environment. Why  implement things SC2 multiplayer doesn't have? Why implement elements from the SC2 campaign? Healing plants, different tower abilities,  enemies guarding bonus towers, those are mechanics that don't fit the successor the game hopes to be. It feels a campaign mission rather than a 1v1.  These are mechanics that don't fit the premise. 

• Absolutely annoyed by having to research the Townhall level. Feels like a chore brought from Age of Empires. The mechanic isn't bad, but it doesn't fit the pace and flavor of Starcraft / Stormgate. 

• The game is more MOBA than RTS. Get more resources from towers than mining. Deny such resources due to a spell from the faction. Almost  insta win spells depending the situation. The classification of units (Bio, Mech, Light, etc) is irrelevant.  Scouting? Magic one hit key.  

• Why cancel isn't the esc key? 

• The graphic style feels like a prototyping when taking a game from sprites to 3D models. Can't tell what does what. Can't judge the enemy forces.  Can't judge visually if a have near complete worker saturation. 
 
• So many times, so many times my rally point is changed do to trying to over simplify things in an RTS. 

• Didn't put a lot of effort, but I shouldn't be painstakingly searching for the option to change enemy color to red, mine to green. Why should I be looking for an option to change from QWERTY layout to Unit/building letter layout. 

• Why are control groups on the right side. Feels like looking at the cellphone while driving. 

• Why is the control and info bar so unreadable.  That mini map sure is mini.

• Map design is just...... annoying. Feels like  MOBA lanes. Send blindly everything with Attack Move and RNG spellcasting. There is no  baiting enemy armies; setting traps with a correct surround;  win a losing fight with available units and mirco; flanking harassment while being attacked, feasible base trades, mind games with the opponent. 

• Why destructible terrain doesn't act like destructible terrain? Some games I couldn't destroy the blocking forest. 

• The game brings new races as a reference to those in Starcraft.  So, why this new races don't play like the ones they are based on?
Vanguard  has Zealot  and Carrier like units?  The ""Marines"" felt sad. 
I guess the infernals feel like Zerg. Wait, what is the visual indicator that I have charges in the townhall? Is it the blood on the shrine or is that little number in the corner? Why do I have to spread shroud with the mechanic from 1998 which feels detrimental? Oh, I see, magic faction spell.....  
I'll try the Celestials. So, do I do warp or don't warp stuff? Why do they require a building for the Luminite? Wait, another for the other resource? Why is this game not what it is based on? 

• Why is this unit not attacking what I was able to attack in a custom game?  

Tried it several times. I'll continue to try, but the design and mechanics are awful.

Truthfully, I really don't see any of that.

Even saying this game plays like a poorly developed SC2 arcade game would be maybe too much of a compliment. The quality and mechanics are no where near that of what it is trying to replicate and it does an overall poor job of even trying to differentiate itself in a meaningful way. I'm all for spiritual successors and putting out new games for a niche market - but they haven't done anything with this that would make me want to play it over Starcraft 2 (Or even Warcraft 3 for that matter). Hell, even the graphics and art style are a huge downgrade from a game that came out over 14 years ago.

The fact that on top of all that the game is incredibly under-developed and now being sold is just all the more reason to avoid it. I get that this is the awful way the game market seemingly functions now where smaller devs have to beg for donations or put out decade spanning betas, but my appetite for that is just completely gone.

In fact, with StarCraft 2 still existing and being as good as it is, it's hard to see what this new data-harvesting product adds to the gaming landscape beyond repeating the past with a slight tweak.

Years, millions of dollars, and ""veteran devs from sc2 and wc3"" and this is what came out? This is bad if you had NO EXPECTATIONS. With expectations, this is a scam. 

I was hesitant to believe the negative reviews, I try to enjoy simple stuff in life, dont need crazy gfx or anything. But, after giving this laggy, buggy, reskin of SC2 with creeps a try, I am a little out of words to say. And when I say reskin I mean it literally. The factions look similar, the units are similar, the gameplay is similar (minus the fact that SC and WC are by far superior), even the number of factions (nevermind how they play, too) is the same.  My eyes hurt from the font and unit size. Took me hours to fix the login screen ping problem. The game was continuously freezing every few seconds.

This is a joke? I had more fun and felt like I was playing a different more unique game in most custom maps I played in either sc or wc.

Also has an ingame store. So the devs def have blizz experience.

steam,172206165,"Background: I've played starcraft/warcraft since the late 90s.

I'm sure i'll have more to say but here are my thoughts after playing the demo ages ago and playing the first mission of the campaign (I haven't spent any money on this game e.g. kickstarter or whatever):

Theme:
The theme is pretty terrible in my opinion but I generally find demons to be a very lame enemy trope. Zero scope for making them interesting. Feeding into this also is the artstyle which i'm fine with but I think works far better in a fantasy setting than this post apoc/sci fi setting.

Singleplayer:
I thought the campaign mission I played was okay and the intro cinematic was actually kinda cool. My heroes seemed to have abilities but I couldn't work out how to use them. The HUD/UI seems oversized and terrible. 

Multiplayer 1v1: 
Definitely feels like they've put all their effort into making this good which i'm happy with since its what i'm most interested in but it feels weird when the stuff that people are actually paying for is singleplayer content... you'd think they'd spend some more effort into developing that. bonus points because from what I can tell the game forces you to queue ranked (no unranked queue) which as a shit player I actually like because otherwise i'd just get mad ladder phobia. 

Anyway, give it a go I guess its f2p",1723760310,2024-08-15 18:18:30

steam,172203921,"I'm not an RTS player, and I didn't expect this game to change that. However I'm going to make this review in the good faith that the developers might want to entice new RTS players or for other newbies. I'm positive some of my complaints will be ""genre staples"" that would upset entrenched players if addressed, but for me these are issues that worsened my experience and don't encourage me to keep playing.

UI/UX:
+ Out-of-game Menus are very clear and easy to understand/navigate.
+ Fonts are slightly stylish but easy to read and subtitles are supported to the extent that I enjoy in most games (not evaluating for accessibility, but no issues noted).
- Lore appears in the bottom right corner by default and automatically disappears until you mouse over to re-reveal and click to dismiss it, which is a pretty bad reading experience.
- Lore can only be picked up by heroes which means you can't sprawl out to catch it when you see it.
- Tooltips can appear _during cutscenes_ which is distracting and not useful.

View/Scrolling in Game:
- In-game edge-based scrolling is atrocious for accessing elements near the edge of the screen. Disabling it is an _option_, but one that the game currently ignores (regardless of what you pick, it will happen).
- Drag-scrolling for map manipulation also feels bad because it teleports the mouse back to the start of the movement when you release it, preventing you from netural-resetting the mouse between moves. There is no option to disable this behavior and it feels very bad.
- Map scrolling is overly sensitive and the least amenable manner to manipulate the camera.
- If keyboard-based camera moves are available, they are not advertised and I did not dig to see if they exist.
- I make a big deal out of scrolling because the default zoom is as far out as it goes and I cannot comfortably see enough of the map to plan routes and movements, especially while uncovering fog of war.

Characters and Characterization:
+ Models look really nice and are distinct in cutscenes...
- But I found it difficult to distinguish some troops from one another in missions. In the third campaign mission, I thought some red soldiers were my blue soldiers merely because they are predominantly grey-colored and I didn't look close enough.
- Heroes talk _incessantly_ when following commands, and they have neither the personality nor variety in voice lines to merit this.
- In the tiny slice of gameplay (67 minutes total client time) I played, the VA work was already subpar in terms of QA. Lines are mumbled past mics, have varying loudness, and are read with the enthusiasm of someone reading the tax code.

Hero Abilities:
+ Add some spice to these special units and I imagine it gives them a lot of very cool design space.
- Are only halfway introduced in the campaign and even then have undocumented abilities (the first skill is a teleport that lists an energy cost + cooldown, but neglects to mention it also has a range limit that is extremely tiny).

Campaign:
- Writing is very slow on the narrative side with almost no feeling of urgency or importance conveyed past the initial exit from a cutscene.
- Major story beats exclusively happen in cutscenes and make your gameplay feel like its an afterthought between moments that matter. In the start of the second mission two of your squad mates straight up leave because they have better things to do despite you outranking them.

Base Management:
- None of the campaign material explains any structures, basic strategies, or units. They even auto-build a base for you the second time you encounter one rather than let you reinforce your learning by building it on the spot.
- I found out (not via the game telling me) that you can build a base upgrade and a unit at the same time, despite the UI not making this clear.
- Announcer messages for bases/units being attacked come years late.",1723758102,2024-08-15 17:41:42

steam,172202551,"[h1] Honest review of the game so far: [/h1]
-   Keep note this game is in Early Access. 

[h3] Intro : [/h3] My view point is very opinion based and new. I do not play games like Warcraft or Starcraft. I play games like Naraka, Total War, Hell Let Loose etc. I like to explore new games, I even have played Stardew Valley for the first time. I just so happen to see this game and wanted to try it. Hope you gain some insight from my experience as a new player in this genre. 


 [h3] First Glance : [/h3] The game has a campaign mode that I personally did not care for. It shows you basic stuff like clicking from the first mission. My big problem is there was no base building mechanics implemented in the first mission nor even talked about. I was really hoping the first mission to entertain me and teach me about the building aspect of the game. The game to me at first glance is more focused on the multiplayer aspect and honestly that is what I wanted.

[h3]  Multiplayer : [/h3] I really did not bother with the Co-Op mode and went straight for the multiplayer. I am aware some of the things I am about to say, have been mentioned or a works in progress. The multiplayer needs skilled based match making according to players level of introduction to these types of games. I feel the past several games I played were against Starcraft players. I know these players play RTS games religiously because I got bum rushed the first 5 minutes. I finally got into a game with a totally new player, and it seems we were both taking our time figuring  out how to play. It was more enjoyable to encounter another player of my level than that of Starcraft player...

[h3] Multiplayer Cont : [/h3] On another note I think there needs to be some balancing between the armies. Celestial's are definitely overpowered. I think as a noob I had 5 bases 4000 Lumi, and if my base got attacked I could easily move it. I did not need to be next to my resources while my guys auto collected around the world and overall the other factions could not keep up. Infernal's needs a faster Re-Spawn timer, from what I witnessed they did not keep up when it comes to any faction. Personally I found Infernal to be super cool still and well that was my downfall..

[h3] Note : [/h3] I assume they will implement some sort of cosmetic aspect to the armies which personally I find awesome. The will eventually add more game modes other than 1v1. I would prefer some sort of king of the hill and defend mode, where you collectively hold a point for a certain amount of time.  Maybe even a 4v4 mode. 

[h3] Final Thoughts : [/h3] Overall the game definitely needs some work. The cut scenes were a little choppy and I wish the campaign was more in depth mostly about the first mission really not explaining base building aspect. I hate that I even clicked there YouTube links to quote on quote ""Learn The Game"". The YouTube videos just briefly described what an RTS was and never really explained about how to play. Overall I had fun even when I was getting my butt kicked by Starcraft players. No reason to get frustrated when im learning the game. Maybe they can space the field out a bit more as a buffer. Good experience and still having fun.",1723756781,2024-08-15 17:19:41

This is an extremely unaccessable game as is and will not be friendly to anyone new to RTS games. Maybe the campaign teaches you, but it costs $25 and I doubt it is in a $25 state at the moment. The coop mode has a cool hero wrinkle to it, but it's only in coop.  It will take you hours to get any sort of feel for this game. There is also only 1v1 as an option. Managing economy can and will make late game a slog at most skill levels becuase you run out of your main resource by your base. When compared to the high octance action of Beyond All Reason, which is also easier to learn when you get the first 3-5 minutes of building down, this seems like its a little too much warcraft 3 and starcraft 2 without enough new ideas to bring big battles and cinematic moments. And hard to master is a stretch when at the present time you just need to know the latest cheese and you're good. This is an APM/Clicks per minute game through and through no matter what they advertise and that is quite disappointing becuase this game could have been so much more.",1723755532,2024-08-15 16:58:52

Then the campaign itself (the free part) is pretty bland and boring.
To play more than the opening 3 levels you have to pay $10 per 3 levels which could make this the worst RTS monetisation of all time.

The AI is also absolutely shocking so you have to play PVP (yes I know that is their main purpose for the game).

Honestly I feel like this game doesn't really fit anywhere. It isn't great for 1v1 or 2v2 gameplay (worse than Starcrafts as mentioned above) and the campaign may as well not exist.

steam,172196412,"I only played through the first mission but the lack of polish is really putting me off.

When I launch a mission, audio begins to play while the loading screen has still not subsided. When the main character shoots its gun, every 3rd shot is silent for some reason. All of the voicelines are recycled from SC1 and SC2 - the voice acting isn't bad, but it's weird to hear the same lines. Unit portraits are AI sloppa, it's rather jarring - just use still images please! Units are surprisingly complex from the getgo, you get access to 3 separate units and a hero with abilities. There's a lot of different enemies but the only enemy unit that made me approach it with any manner of care aside from ""A+click"" was a spellcaster. When my units got hit by a spell that is supposed to apply some dark glow effect, they turned invisible instead, I didn't even know what was happening until I reloaded. For some reason the first mission plays out on a snowy map and a dark factory, so visibility is highly compromised, probably not the best way to go for any mission, let alone the first one. After the mission ended, you could constantly hear the footsteps of an enemy unit from the ending cutscene as you were looking at the post-game stats, I don't even know how something like this gets past QA. The game is extremely taxing on my computer, despite the visuals being entirely ordinary.

I've been putting off playing the campaign because I heard it wasn't perfect on release but I can't say I've been impressed at all. Certainly a big step-up from the early access campaign, but that isn't saying much.",1723751042,2024-08-15 15:44:02

The cumbersome macro mechanics of previous rts games is streamlined efficiently so there's less hotkeys necessary to complete all of the base building, upgrading, and unit producing tasks.

Dont think much. Go ahead and give it 5 mins!

[b]Why there are bad reviews ? [/b]
Most of the [b]negative reviews[/b] are from Starcraft/Warcraft fans, who found out that Stormgate is not a Starcraft.
It's like ""Hey lets downvote Call of Duty because it's not Need For Speed"" ;)

---

[h1]Full review[/h1]

Balance: Good
Gameplay: Good
Graphics: OK (for strategy, in early stages)
Sounds: OK (needs more variety)
Music: Good
Price: Free, but overpriced in-game items (yet not affecting the versus gameplay)

[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]

The single-player is there, but only 3 missions available for free, which overall take ~1hour. Plot seems interesting. A mission takes ~20 minute (up to 30 if you are perfectionist).

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]

[b]1v1[/b]
Played the online 1v1 versus mode most of the time.
Took ~20min per session. Pretty enjoyable, not too long not too short.

[b]Co-Op[/b]
Co-Op is also interesting, it's not like you go and crush the enemy because you have 3 co-op allies. It's keeps thaat enjoyable level of hardness to keep engaged. It's pretty good. This may be the main reason to play the game.

[b]Ranks[/b]
The ranking system is there (MMR - match-making rank), leaderboards is there.
So you play against equal(ish) opponents.
In fact, the ranked 1v1 matches are the most enjoyable part.
If you don't have much time (or patience) but want to have much fun - you will enjoy it.
Takes about 20 mins per session, and gives good level of satisfaction and achievement.

[h1]Early Access state[/h1]

Early access: Pretty stable now. Right now it's playable and enjoyable (both 3 missions of singleplayer, and multiplayer)
Bugs: Overall played 6+ hours, no bug noticed yet.

[h1]The team[/h1]

The team behind the game have worked on Starcraft, Warcraft, Command and Conquer... and they know what RTS is. Hopefully this will be the next great RTS.

[h1]Pricing[/h1]

The price is too high for scenarios and customization.
Just play for free, or buy when its super-cheap.
For devs: This game should be cheaper to succeed. Negative reviews also indicate that.
Its pricing should be more like in Counter Strike and Rocket League - just pay for customization.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

Finally, a strategy that's easy to start, lite to play, and has enough depth only if you want.
If you want to [b]have fun in 20 mins[/b], with MMR, ranks - the online 1v1 is for you.

---
[h1]Note for downvotes[/h1]
There are lots of downvotes, because of wrong expectations. So, lets clarify it :)
[spoiler]
Let's not downvote Stormgate ""because it's not Starcraft"".
If you are a Warcraft and Starcraft fan, and want to see the Starcraft Next - this is not it.

Imagine for a second - if this game's name were Starcraft... We would then complain like ""it has gone in different way"", ""it's a different game but named Starcraft"", etc... right?)
So, it is good that name is not Starcraft. 

It is Stormgate, and thats a different game. It's pretty fine, without comparing.

So lets stop odd downvotes. Lets rate Stormgate as a strategy (not as a Starcraft),
and lets provide constructive feedback to help devs make this game better.

steam,172185201,"I have played many RTS games in my life, from Command & Conquer to Dawn of War, I am a HUGE fan of real time strategy. I love Warcraft and Starcraft. Like many others, I was excited, when Stormgate was announced. 

First Impressions

When the first cinematic was revealed, I was super hyped. But as they revealed more and more, my enthusiasm slowly slipped away. I game's art direction didn't do it for me, but I was willing to give Forst Giant the benefit of the doubt. So I waited. I didn't pre-order, because I'm not paying for promises, I'm paying for fully working, functional games. The gameplay didn't convince me either. I told myself, ""Okay, this looks bland and boring, but this is only alpha/beta, it will be better when it gets released!"", but then I looked at Starcraft 2 Beta, and thought, ""Wow, that mothership looks cool!"", and realized something. Yes, the game is unfinished, but even an unfinished game can show promise. I was rooting for Frost Giant, because I wanted a good, new RTS, something fresh, that will become just as legendary as Warcraft and Starcraft. I really wanted them to succeed. But now that I have seen what the game is, I am just... disappointed.

The Story

Ohhh, boy. A good story can make me fall in love with a game. I fell in love with Brood War, mostly because of it's cool story, not the 1v1 hardcore experience. I am a huge (old) Warcraft lore fan, Warcraft 3 made me instantly fall in love with the world of Azeroth. The story of Dawn of War 1 got me into Warhammer 40k. I love a good story. Unfortunately, the story of Stormgate is... not bad... not good... it's just... there. Amara is unlikeable and bland, her voice actress sounds detached and bored, her whole character model is uncanny nightmare fuel, she looks more horrific then any demon. She is just Arthas, without any of the charm or ""coolness factor"". Let me explain. Arthas becomes detached and vengeful after the Culling of Stratholme, we start seeing signs of his fall in ""The Shores of Northrend"", but that's MISSION 7. It has an impact, because we saw what Arthas was like before. Amara is like that from the start, making her feel bland and unlikeable. Everyone else is a one note character, so Amara's betrayal and corruption by Frostmou... err Thronos doesn't feel that impactful either. And another thing. The lore dumps. PICKING UP AN ITEM THAT GIVES YOU PAGES OF EXPOSITION IS NOT GOOD GAME DESIGN. If you can't put something in the story organically, it's probably not that important or interesting, and deserves to be left out. Just look at the first mission, which is heavily inspired by ""The Defense of Stranbrad"". In that mission, you get Arthas, and a few footmen. You need to defend Stranbrad from the orcs. Simple and fun, it presents Arthas as a heroic paladin, and invests you into the world. On paper, Stormgate does the same thing, but fails at everything. Amara is not a hero, she just wants to murder the enemy, while not showing any emotion other than cold anger. That makes her ""fall"" feel unimpactful. Warcraft 3 didn't have lore dumps either, that constantly flashed on the screen, there was no need, everything was perfectly understandable without them. In Stormgate we are in ""generic forest 31"", and even though the lore is... fine, I don't see it translate into the actual gameplay. Should I really worry about the situation, when the lady's biggest worry is her missing chicken? Warcraft 3 had a similar mission, but there, the gnolls kidnapped a young child, and Arthas didn't know the attack has begun at that point. All in all, the story needs a HUGE rework, even if I disregard the fact, that I'm playing a cheap clone, the narrative is just bland and boring. But, enough of the story. I could write pages on why the stories of Warcraft and Starcraft work, and why Stormgate is falling on it's face, but this segment is already too long, and we have yet to talk about the biggest issue. 

The Gameplay

Remember when I said you got footmen in Defense of Stranbrad? Well, in Stormgate, you start playing as Amara, who has... no abilites. Arthas and the footmen worked well with each other, because Arthas could heal the soldiers, further showing how Arthas cares about his men, through gameplay. Amara is alone, and can only auto attack. Then she gets Carl Barclay a.k.a. Blockade, who... also has no abilities. Also if Amara is a poor man's Arthas, Carl is a poor man's Uther. The uninspired design of the Vanguard faction is one thing, but not having interesting gameplay or levels hurts the game. Both the gameplay and the narrative are boring, worse versions (copies) of older games. Why should I play this, instead of those games? The multiplayer is... ok. It's an RTS game, of course I like playing it... but everything is half baked. Also, the battles are a little hard to read at times, and I think the ""creep camps"" need some refinement. Again, the whole time I was asking myself, ""Why am I just not playing Starcraft/Warcraft, the games that did everything Stormgate does, but better?"" Truth to be told, I was never a hardcore 1v1 fan, as I said, it's something I try if I like the game, but it's not something that will make me like a game. I (and I think many others) want the single player experience good, before getting into competitive 1v1. Of course, coop is kind of a bridge between the two modes, where you play campaign esque missions, with other people. Starcraft 2 coop was successful, because it had factions and characters people already liked. When I sit down to play coop, I sit down to play as Alarak and the Tal'darim, or Mengsk and the Dominion, or Abathur and the Swarm, because look at how cool they are! I loved them in the story, and it feels good playing as them. If I don't care about Amara, why would I want to play as her? Also, yes, Starcraft had the not very creative ""Oh no, Amon is trying to do something, you must stop him!"", as the plot of every coop mission, but Stormgate's coop missions feel underdeveloped both in terms of story, and gameplay. I was bored while playing Stormgate coop, which is sad, because I wanted it to be good. I bought every Starcraft coop commander, and when they announced they won't be making more, I was sad. Here... I have no idea who the celestial commander is, I don't like Amara, Blockade is so forgettable I almost named him Barricade by mistake, etc. Long story short, I don't think I'll spend money on this mode. Which leaves us with...

The Races, the Music, and the World

Vanguard is a generic human sci-fi faction, which feels weird, considering they are the ""the last hope for humanity in a battle for survival"". They don't feel desperate enough, they are too clean, too high tech, too ""Overwatch-esque"" for this world and setting. The Infernal Host is a generic diablo demon faction. Before the third faction was announced, I was hoping it would be something wild. Something exciting, that shakes up the human vs zerg/undead/demon formula. They were joking about anime girls, but honestly, I think actual anime girls would at least have been fun and fresh. Instead, we got... protoss/night elf/angels, as the ""Celestial Armada"". It really feels like a cheap Starcraft clone. These factions fight in a bland ""post-post apocolypse"" world, whatever that means. The music is good at least. The sound effects are mostly fine, although some certainly require more work. 

Final Thoughts

Is Stormgate the worst RTS I have ever played? No. Is it the ""next-gen revival of the RTS genre""? No, I don't think so. As it is now, I think the game's story needs a huge rework from the ground up, the gameplay needs to be refined, and the art direction needs to be reconsidered, mostly for the main characters. Also, I have a good pc, and the frame rate is inconsistent at best. I don't see myself playing this game that much, and there is NO WAY I'm paying for any of this.",1723740090,2024-08-15 12:41:30

Three Races - All very unique, i like!

Graphics - I like it for now - enjoy it for an RTS, but agree with some saying shadows need to improve for ground units (Day9)

Balancing - No idea yet, way to less play time.

Fun - It is fun learning the new mechanics in Stormgate - long-term, no idea if it keeps being fun.

The worst for me in Stormgate so far is the campaign - well i never liked RTS story campaign, played RA2/3 and CnC campaigns early in my puberty. But gotta say that the campaign is not impressive - i left after the first wierd mission. Had no moments that peaked my interest when i was put into the first mission. So thats were it ended for me. 

Co-OP: no experiences so far.

Anyway giving it a like, because for the seasoned RTS player the game is free, which i appreciate a lot. I know a lot of people are angry about the monetization, but but but - you do not have to use it now and shouldnt buy packs if you do not play co-op or enjoy the first campaign missions.

Now I could excuse all of this if the game was still in the early concept stages, but these geniuses decided to put it in early access and are already actively charging you money which basically means it's released. So there's absolutely no going back to the drawing board which this game would so desperately need in order to survive.

For this limited time played I can not express more on strategies and unit diversity. Story looks good (""aliens"" and articfact hunting) and you may see it in the future, I think, like a Starcraft 3, that unfortunetly may never come from Blizz. Has a nice pace similar to S2, and what I don't like is after completing objective you don't have the option to clear map for example. It's just my opinion, I felt the same with S2.

The blatant rip off of starcraft 2 is disheartening and immersion breaking (even using verbatim voice lines), the in-game community is already teetering on toxic, coop is kinda fun I guess but overall strategically everything seems pretty corn-holed, the campaign is meh (the models, yikes) and the first mission is literally a rip off of Warcraft 3.

steam,172180870,"I usually refrain from giving negative reviews for games in the early access phase, unless there are truly egregious issues. Well, I really dislike the art design style of the character Amara; it's too politically correct. The contrast between the childhood version of Amara in the campaign CG and the actual in-game model amplifies this sense of discord (I don't want to see a black mermaid in an RTS game; it's too much and too heavy). 

Of course, if it were just this, it wouldn't warrant a negative review. As you stated in your visual and auditory feedback, ""we’re going to continue to refine our look, but we’re committed to a stylized direction"" which essentially means you don't believe this 'diversity' style needs to be changed, right? Are you planning to continue down the path of DEI? If so, then I'll uninstall now and won't bother waiting for your map editor to be released.

The only remedies for this game at the moment are either to quickly remove the 'diversity' elements, at least returning to the level of 2015 when Heroes of the Storm was first released, rather than Overwatch in 2016 (which marked the beginning of Blizzard's complete downfall).

The gameplay is the only saving grace of this game, because (if you don't have performance problems) feels nice and fluid to control. 

Everything else however feels like the most bland copy of Starcraft 2. You have the Terrans, Zerg, Protoss with new skins and some mixed up new mechanics. Many missions are directly copied from Sc2. The ingame graphics are bad and their toy/plastic artstyle doesn't really work. 

Coop can be fun for a couple of rounds, but you will get bored quickly. There are no modifier or any variation in the mode itself.

The worst offender is the campaign. Please don't waste any money on it. 10$ for 3 missions (2 of them are basically solo missions for your hero character) is just pure greed. The quality isn't there, the cutscenes are offensively bad and there isn't even a Save/Load Game implemented yet. 

Instead of focusing on one thing and doing it right, Frost Giant Studios tried to do everything at once half-baked. The plan 1.0 for next year, but this game needs a lot more time in the oven, especially if they really intend to fix everything.

steam,172174814,"I was really looking forward for this game. It almost sounded too good to be true that developers of Warcraft 3 and Starcraft 2 would create a new indie strategy game? Well it was too good to be true.  

First thing that left bad taste in my mouth was before the game even started, it already forced installation of EAC and refused to start without it, even though I didn't even plan to go anywhere near multiplayer. Who doesn't love to install chinese malware from a company that tries to establish a monopoly for themselves. 

Second, first thing after starting the game, you need account. Why? Yes, I know, it's easy, you just sign it with Steam and play, but this is such an unnecessary step, which hugely increases the costs of the game, as there have to be servers somewhere that handle all these, one would think that ""indie"" company would like to cut the unnecessary cost as much as possible. And why would anyone even want to play their games offline in the age of SteamDeck, right? So yes, you cannot play offline, game will refuse to start.

Finally, we are in! Cinematic starts, subtitles are obviously not enabled by default, because screw accessiblity, after cinematic ends, you are in Campaign menu. There are only 3 missions, but worry not, because Day 0 DLC to the rescue, and it allows you to unlock the rest of the campaign!

So first mission starts, so far cinematics, mission briefings, everything looks a bit long and bland, but it's early access and they still need to finish stuff, so let's play. Game is also kind of bland, units look kind of similar, buildings look almost the same, it's not great, but you can get used to that and you quickly start to recognize them. These are standard tutorial missions, as is tradition in RTS games, trying to familiarize the player with basic controls, mechanics, nothing groundbreaking, except for controls. We had two or three decades of RTS games trying to mostly stabilize the controls, which sort of creates muscle memory so no matter which RTS you are playing, the basic controls are usually the same. Well not here. While some controls behave as expected, others are all over the place and it can be very frustrating. I finished the missions, mostly because I just wanted to be done with it already. 

Originally, I didn't want to talk about graphics, it's early access and everything and it will change, but I have to. Even during the paid early access period, they were still showcasing ""pre-alpha"" graphics in screenshots on Steam Store, and I don't think anything have changed much compared to those (now gone) screenshots. Game looks almost the same, except now it's not pre-alpha. Characters are barely animated, which makes cutscenes feel very weird and robo-like, models look weird, as stated above, everything looks kind of bland and boring, units look similar to each other, buildings suffer from same issues and overall it gives game a very unfinished look. But the main reason why I talk about this, they sell cosmetics. Game looks terrible, but you can buy cosmetics? That sounds insane. 

I understand they have to monetize the game somehow, but they were quite successful on Kickstarter, took several years to develop the game and I can't even see the difference of the current game compared to early footage released long time ago. It's bland and boring, only three missions long, with paid cosmetics, day 0 campaign DLC, infested with malware, online-only... If instead of figuring out how to screw players over they rather focused these resources on how to make the game good, it could have been a huge success, instead of ""Mixed"" review it currently has. 

Maybe the multiplayer is better, although from what I've seen on community forums, it's not, or maybe the Kickstarter backers will have something nicer to say, but from what I have seen they don't. This game is peak ""we have Starcraft 2 at home"" and honestly, the game being superficially very similar to Starcraft 2, makes it look even worse, because people will compare the two games and for now there is a clear winner, miles and miles and miles and miles ahead.",1723729924,2024-08-15 09:52:04
steam,172174738,"I want to start this review by saying I do not usually leave reviews for games. Though as a Starcraft 2 player for many years being compelled by the SC2 / RTS community to support this game I am forced to provide my opinion on this sorry excuse of a RTS game. 

Firstly, the visuals of this game are an eye sore. The graphics are terrible and bright for no good reason. Character models do not look human. The game play is barely original. Units and armies resemble that of other RTS games shamelessly. why should I play this game when Starcraft 2 still exists.

Secondly, the story is cliche and uninspiring. There is no original concept what so ever. One that is compelling anyway. You are pushed into a narrative without context. 

Thirdly, and the most important point of the entire game is the paywalls and micro transactions. I understand that devs and companies need to make money and hit quotas to appease their shareholders, however do not advertise a game as free to play when in reality to experience the better aspects of the game you are forced to buy content.

Conclusion, dear Starcraft community please stop with this stupid RTS stormgate bandwagon. The game sucks, clearly, I am not the only person who feels this way. This game is a con and I will have nothing to do with it today going forward.",1723729847,2024-08-15 09:50:47

steam,172173806,"Did you play BG3 when it was a steaming pile of shit, or after it was all the hype? if you're the former, play stormgate, if youre the latter, dont bother. 

Do you believe marketing bs from other companies and expect early access to essentially mean a complete product? Then this isn't for you. If you're willing to deal and contribute to a developing product and to temper your expectations, then maybe.  

This game is still early access, and what that functionally means, is large parts of it are still practically in beta (at best) / unreleased and or heavily incomplete. Its absolutely a work in progress.  

1v1 is in a good spot and if thats all you care about, its worth playing if you like rts, but if youre easily put off by unfinished products, dont. You'll hate it. 

Numerous features are still lacking, there are bugs, balance is evolving (there was a patch like 2 days before going into early access because of how bad balance was), visuals, lighting and ambient occlusion arent complete, theres a lot that needs improvement and work, so it may put you off. 

1v1 is by far the most complete of the game modes, and is tons of fun, slower than sc2, faster than war3, with some great quality of life features to make macro and general annoying shit more accessible. Suprisingly well balanced all things considered

Co-op and campaign need a lot of work, theyre where 1v1 was a year ago. But i found them both quite a lot of fun none the less, definitely has a lot of promise. But dont come in expecting a highly polished or refined campaign or co-op, theres still literally placeholder art. 

I have a lot of hope that co-op and campaign will have their issues sorted and will be amazing, as will the unreleased 3v3 mode based purely on how much has improved from the alpha to here in terms of 1v1. 

They've crafted a beautiful solid foundation on which to build the rest of the game, what you'll be seeing and playing is that foundation.

A lot of the mixed reviews you're seeing are people who promised themselves things based off of what frostgiant said, without actually paying attention to what was happening, and who dont understand development cycles, or are just butthurt its not starcraft 3.

Overall, game is great fun in 1v1 and the devs have really taken a ton of feedback on board in line with their development processes and goals.    

I have been in since the alpha, also backed on kickstarter as an ultimate founder and cant say i regret or feel cheated at all, game is tons of fun, the most i've had in a very long time, makes me want to have a lan.

steam,172170311,"[h2]Stormgate – A Promising Concept Hampered by Early Access Shortcomings[/h2]

Stormgate has the potential to be a standout title in the real-time strategy genre, reminiscent of classics like Starcraft. However, it feels far from ready for release, even in early access. One of the most glaring issues is the monetization strategy; players are required to purchase most generals upfront rather than offering a free trial or providing access to them in co-op mode. This approach not only limits player engagement but also stifles valuable feedback that could help shape the game's future.

Moreover, the pricing for what’s currently available feels steep, especially considering the quality of the models, which often resemble those found in mobile games. This is particularly concerning, given the hype surrounding Stormgate and the support it has received thus far. Releasing a product that lacks polish and asks for money for basic units feels like a disservice to the community and fans of the genre.

As a long-time enthusiast of real-time strategy games, I find it disappointing to see Stormgate struggle with these fundamental issues. The game has promise, but it urgently needs to address its pricing and accessibility to truly resonate with its audience. Until then, it feels like a missed opportunity rather than the exhilarating return to form that many were hoping for.",1723725098,2024-08-15 08:31:38

steam,172170075,"[h1]Uneasy Lies the Head that Wears a Crown[/h1]
HEY FROST GIANT I'm writing this negative review to get your head straight. You may be the expert in RTS games, but you are apparently ignorant about business.

The first moment I noticed Stormgate was a few month ago, in a promotion video from IGN or somewhere else. I have to admit it was promising: an RTS game made by the original group from SC2, who claimed their ambition to be ""making the best and the future RTS game"".
Now the game has been released, everything back then seems more like a hype. I played less than 2 hours and immediately quit the game. I write reviews only after I'm confident that I know what the game could fully offer. This game seems like an exception: I know that I haven't fully experienced everything out there, but I think there was not much left to be experienced. [b]THE GAME LOOKS LIKE AN ALPHA VERSION.[/b]

Somehow I think I understand what you devs truly try to do here: you want to release an alpha version, because you can develop the game while true players play-testing it, which can significantly help you shape the game into something enjoyable for most of the players.
However, this is apparently [b]not what the players expected[/b]. 
Although you labeled the game as [i]early access[/i] on the store front page, it looks not like one when you continue scrolling down or get into the game: you've already begun selling playable characters and other add-on contents (skins, pets). Is this typical for an early access game? I don't think so. Most of the early access game I know only provides one buying option, which is solely for the game, and updates continuously, maybe through years. Your current marketing strategy (f2p but have in-game purchases) makes people think this is not an alpha but a full release, which will definitely lead to frustration.
On the other hand, you claim the dev team is from SC2 dev team. As a result, players intuitively compares this game with SC2. Obviously, SC2 wins without doubt: it has similar gameplay (just the look and feel) but far more content (either created by the dev or from the community). It even wins in pricing: the playable character in coop mode is much cheaper in SC2 (at least in mainland China, before Blizzard withdrew their business). Currently, this game is beaten at almost every aspect by SC2.

I think I [b]again[/b] understand why you take this marketing strategy: this strategy proved itself on SC2. But it's not gonna work on this game for now. The reason is the lack of content in this game: SC2 offers a lot of free and enjoyable content, including campaigns, coop mode and PvP, which keep the players stay and eventually lead to profit. Personally, I played this game less than 2 hours, and based on the playtime in other reviews, this situation is ubiquitous. How could one pays when they hardly plays the game?

If you admit what I said above is exactly what you think, I can safely conclude: [b]the developing strategy and the marketing strategy contradicts each other.[/b] The developing strategy requires you release an unfinished game and polish it on the go, while the marketing strategy only fits for a final product. It bounds to fail.
I think you should include all the content free to play now as a demo, then add everything else (including the content you plan to update till the 1.0) into a bundle with a reasonable price. Or you should continuously add free playable content in the coming year to make the players stay (and remember to spread this announcement), especially creative customized maps to demonstrate the versality of the map editor and attract content creators in communities.

I hate to see passionate people lose their heart while their journey hardly begins. I hope you developers see this review and make better decisions in the future.",1723724828,2024-08-15 08:27:08
steam,172169908,"Tl;dr undercooked, need more time in the oven.

Since a lot of sc2 pros and content creators were shilling the game I decided to check it out.

Personally I never liked the art style of the game but honestly it should've been last of my concerns. The game looks cheap and undercooked in a lot of places.

Visuals are pretty bland. This is not as bad in campaign missions, but in one coop map and a bunch of pvp maps you fight in a perfectly leveled wasteland while just on the border of the map you can see a lot more detailed world. Compare this to Spellforce 3 maps for example.

The absolute lack of visual or audio impact on attacks and skills. I don't even know what to say, it just makes the game feel completely soulles on top of being pretty unreadable. Just compare it to all them classic blizzard rtses where every unit and ability has distinct combat sound and animation, heck even cnc games have their iconic rifleman ra-ta-ta or tanyas ka-ching.

I know pathfinding and unit movement is a problematic topic for any rts but following previous point - movement just feels icky and i guess ""skatey""? Maybe it's due to land textures or lack of footprints, but it just feels like units slide on or float over the terrain. It is honestly a bit insane to say but Beyond All Reason built on spring engine has way better unit movement and visual-audio readability.

Lastly localisation is just awful. The game decided to butcher itself by pulling out my system language and using it (instead of the steam one at least) and just made my eyes bleed with some incomprehensible mistakes like calling ""Custom"" (as in custom games) ""Настроить"" (???) instead of ""Пользовательские (игры)"". Please just don't do this to yourself.

P.S. RTS genre seem to be on the rise recently with a lot of games already dropping an EA or coming out soon so the competition is pretty fierce. I get that stormgate devs are putting money in esports, but I just don't understand all the pro sc2 players shilling the game in its current severely undercooked state. I think devs underestimate how much good models, attack animations and sounds mean for the game (looking at the controversial 10 dollar hero they probably understand though). But just look at all wh40k games like Battlesector or Gladius or better yet DoWs (1 and 2). As great as they're gameplay-wise they are also stylish to boot. It just feels good using your units in those games. Completely not the case for Stormgate right now, keep it in the oven for now.",1723724629,2024-08-15 08:23:49

With the last new RTS content from Blizzard already being a few years in the past, alot of gamers like myself have been waiting for something new. Yes, there have been indie games, and new age of empires games, but those just don't quite feel like warcraft and starcraft did. Stormgate, being developed by a studio of ex Blizzard developers does have that feel.

art/story: 9/10
Yes, the aestetics are derrivative of stracraft meeting a diablo like lore and backstory. Which funnily enough also draws parrallels to the premise of the DOOM games because of it. Regardless I do like the art and the direction of the campaign story very much.

gameplay/competitive: 7.5/10
With most RTS games still running on older engines and UIs, Stormgate does bring a lot of quality of live improvements that make the game and the genre more accessible, which would help with garnering and maintaining a larger playerbase, which I am all for. All the hotkeys are easily layered in the left side of the keyboard: (QWERT) for different production tabs (ASDFG) to prduce different units/techs regardles of selected production buildings. This streamlines the macro side of gameplay in a way I haven't seen before, and I am loving it. In regards to the micro side, I'm still hoping for improvement. haveing played a few games on the ladder; In regards of armie management it still feels like biggest ball of armie wins the fight. in terms of unit counters, and counter play it feel like there isn't that much yet. Though this might be different once you reach games higher than bronze league, or once a meta get more established, or once more tier 3 units get introduced. Time will tell.

non gameplay interfaces/monitization: 2/10
The fact that campaign missions have been released without a proper safe function is just baffeling to me. This along with other menu featuers, or rather lack thereoff, shows that this game is still very much in developement. Extra salt in the wound is the fact that appearantly an in game shop, and microtransactions have been more important to develop than these basic, and neccesary features. For a game to be this unfinished while already trying to rake in money with these egregiously avaricious practices is a blatant and utter dissapointment to me. This shows to me that these ex blizzard devs didn't leave all bad practices back with activision. With things like war chests in the future roadmap, I do fear for this game. the gameplay is sound and I like the game, I just wish it to not succumb to all these disapointing montization practices current day AAA-game developers are burning their fingers on.

In that regard I do kinda wish that this game didn't have the pay to get in beta, nor this early access release. Call me a nostalgic old coot, but I do long back to the days where a game just gets developed till it is done, and released only at that point. With an expasion of two for additional content down the line when it is popular.",1723723203,2024-08-15 08:00:03

For now thumbs down, the state of Stormgate doesn't justify how much money they raised or how they decided to release the game. This feels like early beta, not EA.",1723723067,2024-08-15 07:57:47

steam,172168409,"Not impressed by anything so far and nothing feels original. But I'll still play the 1v1 'cos I'm a nerd. 
I really wish I would see something that makes me go ""wow"" or ""that's so frickin' sick"" but it's just missing that entirely. No spectacle or surprises or magic so it just feels quite dull. Some stuff is neat, like mechanics that existed in WC3 getting meshed into a mix of SC2 but that's not next-gen as advertised, and so far it's implemented equal to or worse than old-gen. But I get it's EA and a small team, who seem like nice people so I just hope they're not talking shit when they say they're passionate about making a good game.
5-6 years ago I was saying how I would love to see blizz update sc2 to have MOBA mechanics/heroes/creep camps, and maybe some map specific events similar to the campaign missions with lava etc. This game feels like it's kind of doing that but it feels a bit late and also like it's not executing it well.

Feels hard to get excited for future updates though when the campaign was just so damn bad and copying WC3 plot. Like really, Maloc -> Mal'Ganis, Amara -> Arthas. They even have the same first letters in their name. When Amara said she don't give a damn about the men to plastic Uther and picked up Frostmourne... wait I'm confused now. Are we burning the boats or not? I genuinely expected Amara to say she would chase Maloc to the ends of the Earth. Just a very unfortunate segment to choose as the only available campaign showcase.
Btw the monetisation sucks and is kind of misleading.",1723722751,2024-08-15 07:52:31

steam,172167480,"So... a year later stormgate have ""launched"".  but in every regard, this still is an early access game.
i'm a free player, and only played the free content. so my question in this review is, is free stormgate fun?
well. for me, that have been playing rts since the first age of empires, this feels like a 2000 game in 2025. and in that regard its imposible to not compare it to warcraft 3, and specially starcraft 2.
so, how does it compares to warcraft 3? its worse in every way. how does it compare to starcraft 2? its blander in every way. Stormgate commits to the worst kind of science fiction, the one that takes it seriously, look at starcraft, there is irony all over the place, here? not an ounce, not even a grain of irony.
the three free missions are just a vanglorized, boring, stale, no frills tutorial, so, there is nothing there for you, playing vs the ai is fine, its not fun, its fine. fine is the strong word here.
so, stormgate today, a year later is recomendable for free? nah. even playing coop with friends become stale at the third round. its a great example of a game designed 100% around dolphins, so if you are a freeloader the only fun for you is competitive, and the quality of that experience will heavely depend on the player count. 
but even worse, the devs have shown one of the worst actitudes towards early access, community feedback, and social media in general, from manipulated AMA in reddit, to fake steam reviews frrom the managment (including their CEO), to banning every criticism on their platforms, shaming every criticism as ""doomerism"", this was fommented from the users, the mods, and the community managers. all this sycophantic culture just soured every amount of good faith that i could muster in playing, giving feedback, and enjoying the game. 
the thing is no matter how much they launch and relaunch and relaunch this game, the game is still bland, and it feels like thelast 25 years of improvents in videogames LIKE SAVING A GAME, was utterly forgotten. if stormgate released in 2005, i would be totally pissed of at the amount of low quality assets, and the sad amount of ""content"", so even for 2000 standars, the only thing that stormgate brings to the table, are graphics.
are the graphics good? no off course not, they are just fine, functional, nothing shines. so, why would anyone play stormgate in 2025? gameplay is stale, graphics are fine, coop is meh, and the competitive scene is the only thing that could keep a player engaged, and even then, you are going to have a better experience with warcraft 3, a 20 year old game,  that with stormgate.",1723721529,2024-08-15 07:32:09

steam,172166282,"As someone who came for the single player first, coop second and pvp a distant last, this is a resounding nope. Maybe I'll be back when they've done more with it, but that they put this pile out into early access makes me doubt that the team has the capability to build the sort of game that is worth playing, let alone spending money on. 

Mechanics are crisp and neat if that's your thing, but not everyone wants to tunnel vision on theorycrafting the tightest build order. Starcraft and Warcraft stories were cheesy, but we loved them. This is bad fanfiction from people who wanted to make DiabloCraft, and no amount of improved facial animations is going to hide that.

Edit after Early Access finished: Still nope. This is we-have-Starcraft-at-home. All the pieces are there, but they're badly used and they don't understand what made SC1 and SC2 so compelling to play. And there's not enough that's unique to warrant wasting time playing. 

They have no money left if this is what they're calling the end of Early Access, and so I doubt the servers will still be up in 12 months. Even for the bits that are not too badly done, I see no point in investing money in a game that will be dead soon, let alone time.

steam,172165612,"Honestly I'm a bit disappointed, its a 6/10 for me rn. Personally, they should've done playtests as it needs more time in the oven rather than releasing it on early access. I recommend to play the game a bit and give some feedback to the devs as they are listening, it is a free to play afterall. 

Here are my notes:

1. The graphics are like BAR (Beyond All Reason), not as good as SC2 but they can improve. 

2. Theres co-op mode like starcraft 2 (Its okay-ish)

3. Ai is not as clunky since they're aggressive but some units like the sensor drone from the vanguard makes some melee enemies take agro even though there's nothing they can do with it.

4. Gameplay is mid, I feel like its copying starcraft in a way that they have similar units and voice lines too xD 

5. The monetization, I don't mind unless it gives the player an advantage from others but as of now its just heroes for co-op, campaign maps, and cosmetics",1723719086,2024-08-15 06:51:26

steam,172164540,"The game is pretty descent. No bugs I've encountered so far. I don't know why other players are complaining about technical issues. Perhaps they are using a PC from 10 years ago.

The game is free to play. Only a few contents are offered for the free version. Just 1 hero for coop. Free 1 vs 1 skirmish. Free campaign for only 3 chapters.

Since it's a free game, expect nothing more than that. Everything else must be paid.

It's the consequence of utilizing this business model. Free to play, but pay to get everything.

If you hate micro transaction or paywall, then buy other games. If you are a poor person who want a game similar to SC2 quality, then play this one for free. But don't complain if you only get a few things in it. The fault is on you being poor and not the business model of the game.

Nevertheless, I would not recommend this game, because you would need to spend a lot more money than buying SC2, complete with all its DLC. So it's very not worth it.",1723717596,2024-08-15 06:26:36
steam,172164321,"I have concerns with the game's future. There are reports of its financing and its appearance of wanting to milk your wallet of your cash.

I got the game for the co-operative experience, being marketed as a co-op focused experience - I thoroughly enjoyed the co-op on StarCraft 2. It's the only aspect I've played. In its early access state, it isn't as fleshed out as StarCraft 2, and it can be a bit grindy with the number of levels.

I really like the vision, and enjoyed what I've played so far, and it's free, like StarCraft 2. I can't recommend paying for it unless you really enjoy the co-op experience thus far.",1723717341,2024-08-15 06:22:21
steam,172163878,"I was excited to learn about this game when it was first announced, as I'm a big fan of Blizzard's golden age of RTS games. However, after finally getting to play the game, it pains me to admit that Stormgate is not living up to those lofty expectations. The units feel a bit clunky and are too similar to Starcraft thematically. If I wanted to play Starcraft, I would just go play that game instead.

Although I wasn’t a Kickstarter backer, I understand how disheartening it must be for those who pledged significant amounts of money only to encounter gross over-monetization during the ""Early Access"" phase. Pro tip: If you want to attract new players, don’t paywall the features most likely to entice them to check out your game.

I will keep the game in my library and monitor its progress because I’d like a good RTS to play on Steam. However, I can't recommend it to friends until they address most of the user complaints. If they do, I'll update my review.",1723716748,2024-08-15 06:12:28

All I can say is I'll continue to play Starcraft 2, which has better graphics, from what I've seen, a better story, from what I heard, and actually allows me to play the game.",1723716118,2024-08-15 06:01:58
steam,172162719,"TL;DR : Very dissappointed and unimpressed so far with the game.

Veteran RTS Player here with C&C (Red Alert 1, Red Alert 2), Blizzard Games (SC1 and SC2), Total Annihilation and its spiritual successor Supreme Commander 1, Dawn of War 1, a little into the Age of Empires series (AoE2 and AoM). 

So far, I am very dissappointed and unimpressed by what Stormgate is proposing. It feels like a unholy fusion of Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 but a very very poor one. Each faction is nearly a copy-paste of the ones from SC2/WC3 : Vanguard feels like Terran/Human, Infernals feels like Zerg/Undead inspired from Diablo and the Celestials feels like Protoss/Night Elves. Originality is very lacking.

I have only played the first three missions (the free ones), I had flashbacks to WC3 missions and Arthas' story in them all long. That alone gives me an impression of a big lack of originality and even the missions' designs are straight up copy-paste from WC3. I feel like the developpers left all their good ideas behind with Blizzard.

And that is without even talking about the monetization of the game ...

Starcraft 2 is a superior experience overall compared to the actual state of Stormgate so far. While it is not fair to compare a finished game to this one, the latter did a very very poor job to convince me that it will be better than SC2 with what it proposed. I recommand to play SC2 instead.",1723715093,2024-08-15 05:44:53

Campaign is not worth spending money on yet so if that's what you're looking for in the game then I think it's best to wait and check back later.

Coop is fun but also still pretty clearly a work in progress.

Ultimately I think the multiplayer is going to end up being worthy of comparison to Blizzard RTS games but the campaign is currently lacking and has a long way to go.

May 2025 update: Game is coming along well. Campaign is MUCH better and the multiplayer is improving further. This is how the game should have launched into early access as it's probably only just at the point where it can make a positive first impression.",1723713986,2024-08-15 05:26:26

No pause button in single player... really? No saves!?!?! The audio is scuffed and broken beyond belief. The graphics are painfully bad. How did this get released? Do they have no shame? Even after fixing these issues, the core gameplay is still very weak and bare bones compared to much older RTS titles from literally decades ago. I'm not convinced that's going to improve with development time. I really hope the devs can prove me wrong.

Take note that many RTS pros have already come and gone -- while they might be saying nice things to keep their relationship with the devs in good standing, they're not sticking with the game, which speaks volumes.

steam,172151757,"This is an updated review from a Kickstarter backer after playing the new Campaign on Brutal in 0.4 and giving Stormgate a thumbs down at Early Access launch.

First off, this update is fantastic. The devs should be proud for sticking to it and being able to deliver on this update. It made me much more optimistic about the future of this game. I will divide this review into sections and separating multiplayer to better discuss those aspects as well.

POSITIVE:
- A lot and I mean a lot of the worst aspects of Stormgate have been addressed in the last few patches. Still much more needed to be done, but this patch really gives a better idea of the vision of this game and what makes Stormgate different from WarCraft and StarCraft.
- Stormgate has finally found its hook in regards to the story. The introduction to Amara and the world is done so well to get you engaged in this universe. Mission 1 especially is absolutely dripping with atmosphere.
- The new intro cinematic sets the new tone for the story beautifully with excellent cinematography that delivers on the previously mentioned hook.
- The characters are finally likeable across the board. Amara is the biggest glowup with her going from an insufferable girlboss who only cares about her own revenge to an inexperienced upstart in the military that cares about her fellow man. Blockade works so much better as the commanding officer that acts as the voice of reason and the calculated decision maker. Ryker is no longer just quote-unquote ""wrong"" about everything and instead is the independent rebel leader that has to join the Vanguard cause while questioning some of the motives of the high command. It is fun having more side characters to make the Vanguard feel like a much bigger organisation this time around.
- The Campaign hub is a fantastic starting point for giving the characters room to breathe and for pacing the story.
- All the dialogue is voice acted for the Campaign. 
- Having Bill Roper voice the little robot T.R.I.P.P. was a very fun nostalgia kick by having heard his voice for a ton of units from WarCraft 2 & 3. ""Work work!""
- The pacing of different story beats is significantly better this time around. There are some unfinished cinematics and bugs when finishing each mission, but the pacing works to make moving from mission to mission feel less disjointed.
- Maloc and the Infernals have a lot more gravitas. The mystery surrounding their origins and motivations work a lot better for making them feel genuinely threatening.
- The mission variety and quality are a massive step up from the previous Campaign. We have at least 4 completely new environmental biomes in 0.4 and more work done to lighting, VFX, and art assets. The maps are gorgeous with them having a lot more storytelling going on.
- We are given a lot more context this time around about different creatures and details about the world that were never addressed in the old Campaign. Characters now appropriately respond to different discoveries like some zombie demons walking through corridors of some abandoned facility or some mystical artifact pulsating strange energies.
- The story rewrite was very much needed and 0.4 basically addresses every single major complaint I had about the story, characters, the world, and so on. Once finishing the 6 missions I was left wanting more.
- Level design is a massive step up this time around. The rewards for looking around the map are actually very cool and with so many strong Hero items lying around you always have a good reason to go off the beaten path.
- Hero and army customization are finally a thing. Levelling, upgrades, items, etc. Those changes alone do a lot of heavy work to add replayability to the current missions. You will have to make some tough choices on what you want to spend your resources on.
- Amara has a much better ability kit. Her heal could however be nerfed, since it trivializes the difficulty early on in the game.
- The new art direction is doing wonders. While a lot of it is still a work in progress, the quality is very noticeable. Everything from little icons to units have been redesigned or have been polished up to give a much clearer idea of how the final game is going to look like.
- Audio in 0.3 and 0.4 are a massive step up from previous builds. More and more bugs have been fixed and and subtle audio cues are becoming clearer to inform you about what is going on.
- Save/Load for the Campaign is great.
- 0.3 introduced the new hotkeys and control groups systems that have been further polished in 0.4. A much better system than what we had in StarCraft 2. The Quick Macro panel is as usual great and fit well with the other systems.
- Controls are getting closer and closer to matching the quality of StarCraft 2.
- Animated character portraits with lipync really adds a lot to the visual experience. I know that the devs have been using AI to achieve this, but I think it makes financial sense to do it considering the size of the team. The art is still being worked on by real artists and it hasn't replaced anyone on the team, so to me I think this is a reasonable and ethical way of using this new technology. 

MIXED:
- The difficulty hasn't been tuned properly yet on Brutal. I.e. there is a lot of dead time in the first half of Mission 5 that actually trivializes the last half if you just gather resources and max out your armies.
- The Campaign cutscenes and other little things are unfinished still, but those issues do not take away a ton from the overall experience.
- The animated character portraits have some weird lipsyncing. Amara and Blockade have very good looking portraits while Ryker's doesn't look as good.
- Tara's voice acting is a bit clunky, likely due to inexperience. She has a good voice and she can deliver good lines, but in some of the more lengthy conversations the quality is not as consistent as the other actors.
- The exposition dialogue could be toned down a bit.
- A bunch of spelling errors and text that do not match the words that the actors speak.
- Being forced to listen to the same dialogue in the hub over and over again for each Campaign playthrough is going to be tedious. There needs to be a way to skip straight to the mission briefing if you have already completed the Campaign once.
- More polish of the conversation system is needed to allow you to talk to NPCs that have bonus dialogue without needing to click on them multiple times. 
- NPCs in the hub that you do not interact with should have non-voiced dialogue to make the ship feel more alive with small side gags and short stories. Maybe add small side quests about gathering items found in different missions for some fun rewards?

NEGATIVE:
- Unit readability on Shroud for Infernals got a bit of a downgrade from last patch. The fog overwhelms the units.
- The scale of units needs another pass. Hedgehogs being smaller in stature than Exos and Lancers look weird. It also affects the Infernals like the Brute that can easily clump together and be hard to read how many there are.
- Co-op is in this weird limbo right now where it retains everything from before patch 0.4, which leads to having old models mixed in with new VFX and you not being able to play around with the new changes done to the factions. This will eventually be fixed, but as of now Co-op does not match the quality of 1vs1 and the Campaign.
- Creep camps are still lacking in both 1vs1 and Co-op.

MULTIPLAYER:
- I'm not yet playing 1vs1 due to the lack of the full tier 3 roster, but based on the improvements done since launch the gameplay has been going in a very good direction. Worker harrass is finally viable.
- There is still no team based PvP mode, so it makes it harder for me to get invested into playing the multiplayer on a regular basis besides doing a bit of Co-op on occasion. Those updates are however planned to be coming out later this year according to the devs, so I will be keeping a watchful eye on the game until then.",1723697323,2024-08-15 00:48:43
steam,172151496,"Pretty disappointed with the current state of the game. Performance issues and general jank are plentiful, but these can be sorted out over time.  I understand this is 'early access' but my main complaints with the game don't really seem to be easily fixable.  This games seems content to rehash a lot of the same ground as SC2/WC3 with minor twists to change things up. 

Visuals are not poorly executed, but subjectively are really unappealing to me. Art direction seems to just be 'generic competitive multiplayer game', as opposed to any sort of coherent vision.  Factions are, in terms of flavor,   just bootlegs of pre-existing Blizzard factions.

Campaign is just sad and boring, I would think this needs to be redone to be worth any money. Lacks any of the storytelling from SC1/WC3, none of the fun RPG stuff from SC2. Cut-scenes are quite lame and voice acting is stiff.  Missions are just re-dos of previous Blizzard titles.

Co-op is okay, but is basically the same as SC2 with no innovation.

Mechanically, some cool new QoL things, like the new macro tools. 1v1s seem to be the strong suit of this game, but it is really only a marginal upgrade to SC2.

Not a bad RTS, but an exceedingly generic one that I can't recommend anyone spend money on (it has that same terrible newer-blizzard monetization). Unlike many other amazing early access titles, I do not see the potential for this to become a great game. I'll probably revisit later to see if they really turn this around, but I don't have my hopes up.",1723696850,2024-08-15 00:40:50
steam,172151461,"Quite the disappointment, even for early access, it needs MAJOR, MAJOR work. There is $9,99 DLC for 3 missions of the main campaign on day-1 (after tutorial).  As it stands, this game is barely even on par with the current RTSs. In many respects, it is worse that RTSs like WC3, that came out 20 years ago. ForstGiant have been very misleading in their promises and underwhelming in delivery - I find it hard to trust them to improve this game in good faith

Even though I didn't lose any money on this, given how much hype they put around the game being the next big RTS, and how much I was looking forward to it, I absolutely feel let down. I hope they make major, major, overhauls and don't lose their players in the coming months, so they can at least get out of early access. 

The graphics and art-style are so bad and un-serious, I don't even know what to say.  I can not see how they will bring it to a level that is respectable and near the quality that is apparent in competing games. The game's graphics/art-style combo, especially in the closeups and cut-scenes, seem worse than WC3 when it came out 20yrs ago - and far far worse than SC2. 

I was very hyped for this game and have followed almost all the online content and tournaments leading up to now, the strats, builds, etc. Honestly, I was hoping it feels better to play 1v1s than it looked when I watched others play it. Sadly, that was not the case. There is nothing interesting or new in this game, that is not already done better in past games that they claim to improve on. It plays like a worse amalgamation of SC2 and WC3. 

I played a couple of missions on the campaign- it was so bad, cliche, and cringe-worthy, that I am surprised it's from the same people who made WC3 and SC2. The characters, dialogue, and missions are mundane and have no originality. After the tutorial missions, you have to pay 9.99 to continue, on the very first main campaign!?! BTW they reserve the right raise the price of the game and DLCs at a future date even if they don't 'anticipate' it now. What kind of model is that?

steam,172148545,"Stormgate is the kind of RTS I enjoy playing.  It's not perfect.  There's lots of performance issues.  It's unstable and it's in early access, so there's a lot of changes that happen relatively rapidly.  However, if you're able to cleanly run the game, it's quite fun in the co-op and versus modes.  It has a longer time to kill than either starcraft game, but a faster time to kill than warcraft 3.

If you're a campaign enjoyer and not interested in multiplayer, I'd stay away for now.  The cinematics and character splashes use in-game models, which have their proportions skewed for viewability at the top-down perspective and are not intended for viewing up close and evenly - this is going to be changed, but right now it looks goofy.  Campaign writing and level design is nothing special, but I'm also not a huge fan of vanguard, which is the faction featured in the current chapters of the campaign.

1v1 and coop feature 3 assymmetric factions which are still incomplete, but are quite fleshed out.  Matchmaking tends to be quicker than looking for a game of Dota, and my games last anywhere between 3 and 30 minutes.  There's not a great onboarding process yet, so if you decide to pick it up, I recommend playing a few rounds versus AI before moving on to pvp.

Is it fun? Yes. And that's what matters.

It definitely needs some polish, but that's what early access is about, and I think what we have so far is promising. I was a little skeptical about this game after being burned by Homeworld 3 (which was a major disappointment), but I think Frost Giant is doing a good job. You can definitely feel the Starcraft 2 influences here, but this also makes a number of neat improvements over SC2's design, such as better base management, a better co-op experience (SC2's co-op has gotten bland for me), etc. The Buddy Bot feature, in particular, is one I like since my APM kinda sucks and I don't play Versus.

steam,172146747,"This is a game that I would overall describe as ""just okay."" It's not terrible, but it's not all that good, either. As an RTS, it works at a fundamental level. You build buildings, you build units, you fight your enemy. The performance is fine, the graphics are... passable, at least. As far as balance or gameplay depth, it's a bit too early to say, but I feel as though it's about on point, for an RTS of this caliber.

However, this game being ""just okay"" is exactly the reason I can't recommend it. Instead of playing this, you could just play Starcraft 2 or Warcraft 3, both of which offer vastly more in terms of singleplayer and community content. Sure, Stormgate is F2P, but so is Starcraft 2, and it's a far more polished and enjoyable game overall, imo. If you're not interested in the Stormgate competitive scene (assuming it ever has one), and you don't want to buy any of the singleplayer expansion packs, there isn't much of a reason to play it for more than a few hours, at most.

I get that it's still in early access, and that it could change a lot in the coming years, assuming it does get consistent content updates, but I don't see it overcoming its own mediocrity anytime soon. Stormgate suffers from the same issue a lot of new RTS games have already faced. Its devs are too afraid to break away from the established molds and tropes of the genre, so they create something that ends up just feeling like a shoddy imitation of an existing RTS game.",1723689094,2024-08-14 22:31:34

The xp grind is alot longer per hero level, the upgrades aren't too creative and well designed, whereas Starcraft 2 the commanders felt like the other half of how a race plays. There's a glitch where no units can do damage if the match lasts too long, there's constant leavers in matchmaking that aren't replaced by AI, and the 6 co-op missions don't really stand out in any way, if anything they're also derivative of Starcraft 2's co-op missions.

steam,172144081,"First impression least for me isn't bad. I didn't pay anything and waited for the free version. Game still looks unfinished but the bones of the game works really well. I like the new macro options and I would say this game is new player friendly, easy to learn hard to master. I still love SC2 and WC3 but Stormgate is in a good spot for today's RTS.


Update from a Month Later...
In my initial review, I mentioned that the ""bones of the game work really well."" I'd like to update this after playing Stormgate on and off for about a month. I'm currently climbing from Bronze, so while I'm not a pro, I want to share my experience from a new player's perspective. I’m decently good at SC2 (currently ranked Platinum 1), so I expect to rank up in Stormgate as I improve and eventually move out of Bronze. I started at around 600 MMR and now I'm at 1,200 MMR.

Right now, macro play is incredibly strong, though I'm not sure how this will hold up at higher ranks. I generally win games by focusing on macro, with less emphasis on unit composition. I expect that unit composition will become more critical at higher levels. As for micro, it definitely matters in this game (e.g., dodging Atlas shots or AoE spells). The top ability bar is a cool feature, and I hope it gets refined as the game evolves.

I appreciate the developers providing a roadmap for upcoming features, and I'm excited about the future of 3v3s. I haven’t purchased anything from Stormgate yet, but I hope the available items or bundles will be worth it. While I don’t expect to pay for in-game content, I suspect that some of the purchasable content might feel underwhelming. Skins can be cool, but in a melee game, readability is key. Buying a campaign makes sense, but only if it's polished. I don’t play co-op much, but I know it’s popular with others.

I’d love to see an Archon mode, like in SC2, along with in-game voice chat and more social features. Even though Archon mode is a niche feature in SC2 and doesn’t attract as many players as 1v1, it’s still worth implementing. From a spectator's perspective, it's awesome to watch two or more pros teaming up against another set of pros.

That said, the game’s foundation still needs some work, especially when it comes to issuing commands to buildings with workers and pathing issues that occur at times.",1723684830,2024-08-14 21:20:30

steam,172143358,"First of - I'm a huge fan of Stacraft 2 franchise, and I still play the game, not e-sport, but co-op and vs Ai with my friends. And occassionally once in several years I complete all 3 campaigns all over again trying to find something new to myself or complete achievements. It's a great game. I came to starcraft 2 after playing warcraft 3, big fan of that game too.

Man I was excited to hear the news about Frost Giant starting their work on new RTS franchise. I knew these guys won't fail, but the outcome is meh. 

FIrst of, the idea of angels vs demons is awesome, love it and always wanted to play such RTS, but why sci-fi terrans? Just why?! They don't fit this confrontation AT ALL. It'd be an amazing game if humans were just medival, with no stupid space tech. Paladin and Assassin as classes would have fit that universe and lore amazingly well, but somehow you decided that you need starcraft and diablo remix. VERY bad choice seems to me. 

Secondly, after playing beta, co-op 3 players vs AI, I was like why?! Wouldn't it be eaier to make 2 players co-op like in SC2? It works perfectly well there and I love it with all my heart, but co-op here just sucks. 

Base building system, it's so unnatural to those who came from WC3 and SC2, I don't know why you just didn't copy your legacy in terms of building the base and units? Why inventing something that people would have to get used to? You know that old players don't like changes, don't you? 

Campaign - 3 first missions were boring. Cutscenes made on engine with character models from the game are ugly as hell. In SC2 you had high poly models for cutscenes and on-engine cinematics and they are awesome, I didn't skip any dialogue in the game. Here - they are just ugly. I know that you might change them later but still, asking money for early release like this looks like scam to me. Opening cinematic was OK, not great like in SC2 or WoW, but OK.

Sorry guys, I know you wanted to please your players with amazing quality of a product and fun gameplay, but it's not fun to me for the reasons mentioned above.

steam,172142136,"An absolute abomination of a game. This is supposed to be made with people that worked on SC2? No way...
- The sounds are horrible - both in atmosphere and quality.
- Sounds are not not even normalised for level, some stuff (e.g. voice lines) is super loud, especially in the campaign
- The UI looks like it's made by someone working on his first mobile game ever
- The units are a joke, a freaking whirlwind barbarian space marine? Did chagpt randomly give you suggestions or did anyone ever even look at this before release?
- The graphics are bad and dated, feels like a torchlight meets warcraft
- The cut scenes are atrocious, not even lips move when talking and possibly the worst looking stuff I've seen. AI would've done it 10x better
- The ""campaign"" feels like it's ""written"" by chatgpt
- The campaign missions feel soulless and done by someone who hates the player
- Not even decorations on the maps make sense - goats coming out from chicken coops?! c'mon guys, have you never been outside in your life? Heck, teen kids do 10x better map mods on SC2 than your campaign team! It's an outright disgrace

And now you might say: but, but this is free!?
Well, so is SC2 - however - co-op commanders for this ugly mess cost more or the same.
The campaign costs from mission 4 onward (10€/$ for 3 missions...).
The bundles cost more than SC2.
This simply is a cashgrab. Decades below the quality of SC2 but same price or even more.

steam,172141998,"[h1]2 Deal-breakers[/h1] 
one caveat i'll say before my criticism is that the game is great for people that love just straight PVP but for someone that was looking forward to the co-op and campaign mainly there are 2 big dealbreakers.

[h3]1. CO-OP [/h3] For co-op you only get one character, at the very least you should get one of each race, to be able to play at least your favorite race not be forced to just one. i was excited for co-op, but not without being able to try the races that i'm interested in, and im not really interested in paying just to see if i like it. they had the perfect framework in SC2, let us try every hero for the first couple of levels and charge after that.

[h3]2. Campaign [/h3] Not selling full campaigns, but campaign chapters is insane. the cost of a full campaign is going to end up being incredibly high. if i was paying that price or 3X that price for a full campaign, but not that for every 3 missions.

[h3]Bonus Fact.[/h3] Weird fact, the game has my GPU at full throttle super hot, and the graphics have no business doing that to a 4080.

[b]i'm very disappointed[/b]. i know it's free to play but this feels pretty stingy, and it sours the whole experience for someone that is not interested in multiplayer.",1723681555,2024-08-14 20:25:55

steam,172134365,"coming from SC BW and SC2 this has a long road ahead. not sure if it was my computer or others having the same problem.

1. in the campaign none of the videos work. if it shows more then a black screen it will frame freeze and never update. 

2. (this i hope will change at launch) it sounds like the voice actors are just people from the side of the road.

3. in COOP mode 20 mins in game the delay from actions gets worse. at the start of a game 0 delay input. 10 mins in i get 10 sec delay input. near the end of the game i timed it. i was getting a 40 sec delay to my commands. so if i tell my army an attack command they will sit there for 40 sec till they decide to move out. i guess there going for realism. 

4. the SMALL campaign we got is not even close to being worth 60 bucks... the choices you can make, dont feel like it matters unlike SC2 helping Tosh or helping Nove you get a different mission. there is no choices like adding bonus to units. in SC2 campaign you can add range to firebats or upgrading HP. stuff only found in the campaign and will not find in 1v1 latter. no cool crazy units. i could go on forever about this.

5. i cant put my finger on this one but it just dont feel good to play. its clunky and just not fun.

 i put so little time in to the game due to it not working right and not fun. i know the devs mean well but the game was not ready for EA. the ideas they have are good and i hope one day i can delete this comment and re right it. one of the best things from SC2 was that someone out of there own time made a 3 player COOP campaign from the SC2 campaign and im about to do a 4th run through with some friends. one day im hoping to do this in stormgate.",1723671081,2024-08-14 17:31:21

Nothing in this game has any weight whatsoever in combat.  Stuff like Archangel's landing impact should be accommodated with killer sound effects and impact craters - nothing.  The entire celestial arsenal is lacking sound design and impact - whether it be mining, power surging, or fighting.  When a not-siege tank posts up, and has a weapon called the BFG, I expect some kind of awe inspiring shot with audio feedback that puts the fear in the enemy.  Nothing.  It shoots a limp shot with all the might of a dragoon projectile.

It doesn't matter if it's a skirmish killing workers or a massive attack move blob battle in coop, the entire game feels muted and bland in action.  Even stuff like Singularity, which is like a ramping psi storm, feels insignificant.  You can't make ability use feel insignificant!  If I am about to die to a black hole I should have way more feedback to why my backline just got wiped!

Doing away with weapon and armor upgrades makes some units feel incomplete or awful to scale, and removes some dynamic power shift moments.

The devs are doing too much at once - a monetized campaign, a competitive scene, a coop monetization.  Stop spreading yourselves thin.  Focus on your moment to moment gameplay.

found out after the game heroes only go to level 5 and have to pay to unlock more skills, making it P2W.

the campaign has nice slow introduction of new units and building which ends up being the actual tutorial, but however you only get 3 mission to play and have to pay to unlock the rest.

steam,172130136,"A lot of people have been empathizing with the CEO, but frankly the empathy is undeserved.

Stromgate was indeed a scam. No, this isn't even about how they took over 40 million dollars from investors and community and delivered a product worse than what 2 indie devs could make with a 50k budget. What I'm talking about is ethics. False advertising, narrative control, fake reviews - all for money.

Make no mistake, Frost Giant IS a malicious and dishonest company. They have been doing everything they can to mislead customers and investors into giving them money. Outright unethical and misleading claims were all over the place. For example, they claimed that Wings of Liberty was their ""previous product"" despite most of the devs having never even touched a blizzard game before LOTV. They ninja-edited the kickstarter page so they could give less than promised after everybody had spent their money. They paid famous content creators to shill the game non-stop but claimed the company had nothing to do with it to create false hype. As for the community, they have been using all their power to ban anyone who speaks against the company on Discord, Reddit and Steam; A LOT of effort had been spent on this throughout the game's short lifespan. A major part of the company's job is to control and falsely present the game's online image at the expense of users. Believe me, if they could remove your Steam review and ban you from making negative ones, THEY WOULD in a heartbeat. Let me remind you all this online info ops were done for money, not your interest. There's a very ugly mentality behind this. And of course it was confirmed that FG made new Steam accounts to post fake positive reviews out of desperation since they found out they couldn't ban user reviews. 

Misrepresenting the game by lying and astroturfing for your own monetary gain IS malicious and IS scamming. Most people just think this is a bad game but they don't realize the evil behind the scene. Honesty is important. If you use unjustified means to stop people from criticizing you in fear of losing money, the nature of the operation changes completely. We simply don't need this kind of toxic companies making our games.",1723666084,2024-08-14 16:08:04

The graphics are a severe downgrade, the mechanics for the Infernals feels like a cheap copy and paste of Zerg mechanics (and somehow less interesting), and otherwise lacks anything that feels 'next-gen'. I'd be curious to know from others what they feel is a marked improvement from SC2 or what exactly makes this game an 'upgrade' to the RTS genre. 

I, like many others, was very excited to see another 'blizz-like' RTS in the works and I really want to see this game succeed.

That said, I do hope they take another look at their pricing, especially with the campaign.

I also fervently hope that this **SPOILERS** fast forward arthas downfall with amara **/SPOILERS** leads to a more interesting story that we haven't necessarily heard before.

steam,172121271,"Stormgate had a rocky start when it launched into Early Access on August 13, 2024, drawing criticism for its underwhelming visuals and lack of identity. However, recent updates have significantly improved the game and shown strong progress from the development team.

Patch 0.4 (released on April 22, 2025) brought a major overhaul to the campaign. While the new campagin does not quite reach the heights of StarCraft II's campagin, it now offers an enjoyable few hours of content. The patch also introduced updated lighting and improved visuals for many Vanguard and Infernal units, addressing one of the game's earlier weaknesses.

Patch 0.5 (released on June 24, 2025) pushed things further with additional visual upgrades and a significant rework of 1v1 gameplay. The removal of creep camps and the introduction of Stormgates — map-based objectives that reward map control — gives the game a more dynamic feel. These Stormgates not only distinguish Stormgate from other RTS titles but also give newer players incentives to go out of their base during the earlier stages of a match.

The focus remains on 1v1 multiplayer for now, and in its current state, Stormgate is a solid recommendation for competitive RTS players. Those more interested in co-op, campaign, or custom maps may want to try a few matches to see how the game feels, but may prefer to wait for future updates targeting those modes.

Overall, Stormgate is finding its footing, and with the steady improvements seen in patches 0.4 and 0.5, the future looks promising.

There is a bit of a pathing issue, many units stumble upon each other and many unit models are much smaller than their physical size.
I hope that FrostGiant can improve  campaign and coop since they are gateway to a competetive 1v1. I think many of us who played SC2 or any other RTS started with the campaign. As of right now the state of campaign is outrageous, won't even consider playing it.",1723654655,2024-08-14 12:57:35

steam,172119387,"No lags, no screen tearing. Every mission loading flawlessly, whether I was battling in a 1v1 or against bots. While some other people talk about gettin stuck in loading screens, I never faced such an issue.

Yet, not all is perfect. I noticed what i think were some hackers on the official Discord, asking about the anti-cheat system, all the while lamenting their bans. Fun stuff, they already leaving SC2 to get in this and gettin wrecked by the anti cheat. I dont think anti-cheat would just ban people for nothing. People dont get bans out of nowhere and if they do, ya would usually go in discord to ask about what happened and not trying to pull detailed tech information on how the anti-cheat does things.

Navigating the game took me a minute, especially when I was just getting acquainted with the various units and buildings. At first glance, they seemed unfamiliar, as they should, but over bit of time everything lands as the units and buildings are very easy to tell apart from each other. An enticing aspect of the game is the co-op mode, where I could level up heroes to level 5, yes the heroes in co-op are free up till level 5 so you can decide if you want to buy them or nah.

Sure, I expected a few monetization strategies, skins, colors, and the necessary shader adjustments to keep the game afloat. But the essentials are free. The art style? It felt quirky, maybe even a bit odd, but looks aren’t the focus. Instead, gameplay took center stage, and, oh, is there plenty of it.

This is a game crafted thoughtfully, not by a disgusteen mega-corporation that asks you if you guys have phones, but by passionate developers.
With my past experience in playtesting some other games i will say I would keep an open mind, things are goin to change alot. So if you dont like things now, you may later on, but i feel like this is highly accessible even to the new players just please dont pull your workers away, you know who you are, i see you.

Now, i see people talk about having to buy a co-op hero after paying the 60 dolar kickstarter, obviously untrue, it was well known that for the 60 dolar price we get 3 heroes, one for each faction, not 4 heroes. Meaning we all got what we were said we would. Why are ya making up shit i dont understand, but ok, i guess they need it for ego or i dunno what haters do to feel accomplished right but that is how it is. Everyone got what was said we will get, Warz came after and wasnt part of the deal, yet what i heard frost giant still givin the next hero out for free cuz of this. Fine, like whatevs but unecessary.

Summary: In my many and many and oh so many, im so old and i wanna cry, years of starcraft 2 i can say based on everything, Starcraft is still an superior RTS, but also made by much bigger company with much bigger budget and many stolen breast milk bottles, so if im to choose, Stormgate is better, yes.",1723653867,2024-08-14 12:44:27
steam,172118683,"[h1] Played a good 12 hours so far, here are my thoughts: 
 [/h1]

[h1] The Pros:  
 [/h1]

It plays really, really good - super fluid, very responsive

It`s a very creative mix of Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3: The Frozen Throne which gives it a lot of new tactical layers: Creeps don't just give XP, they can uncover parts of the map or give ressource boosts

Controls are very smart - you can essentially order an entire army without going back to your HQ, which allows more focus on the battlefield 

When you play Vanguard, your turret changes based on the unit you put in - so you can combine an artillery turret with a healing turret or a repair one, which is very smart design and super fun to play when you want to turtle in - I like a heavy protected base :O)

There is a ton of meta strategies, since you can activate all kinds of buffs and attacks for individual units 

In general I like the unit composition, would love a tank though - so far there is only artillery which can be mobile or stationed. 

[h1] The Cons:  
 [/h1]
It doesn't look great, graphics are quite outdated. Starcraft 2 looks much more cinematic, particle effects are much more present. Also Starcraft 2 maps carry a lot of storytelling in them, they are very atmospheric which I am missing in Stormgate. This needs to be improved, especially since this is supposed to be a big new esports, so it needs to be fun to watch. 

The campaign looks off - devs have already adressed that character models were not meant for close-up perspective and they are working on it, but i've expected much more. 

Overall I am having a lot of fun so far and learn new metas and strategies with every single game, Stormgate definitely has depth and a ton of potential. But it needs a massive graphical update.

steam,172118473,"I'm going to stretch myself here to try to write something that doesn't come off as overly emotional or pretentious, and apologize in advance if I fail in that particular goal. Sooo... um. Here we go.

Stormgate is an early access game. It's listed as such on Steam, it feels early access, and it has the lack of content that one would generally expect from modern early access games. And while this would ordinarily be a reason to pause and reassess an opinion in the hope that the game will improve in the future as it crawls towards its final release, there are certain aspects of Stormgate that I have doubts about.

First and foremost is the art style and character design. It's not as directly noticable on the non-human factions, as... well, the uncanny valley of believable design is more easily put aside for characters that are directly non-human. Where this truly comes into view is the character of Amara, one of the heroes in the campaign and co-op mode. As the character we play as in the very first campaign mission, one would perhaps hope that the design was interesting or at least relatively alright to look at, as she is set up as the protagonist of the human campaign, but even in the rendered cutscenes, her entire appearance just feels... off. Her arms are unnaturally long, while the rest of her proportions seem squashed down, leaving to an incredibly unnatural feeling every time you see the image of her while you're loading into a co-op map, or in a cutscene. 

This, along with some lacking particle effects, death animations, death effects, and other similar things along this line, lend itself to a feeling that the current game as it stands needs a lot more work by artists, animators, and similar tracks to actually make the 'feel' of the game come back on track. Whenever a large objective in co-op simply... poofs away when killed, with a tiny little almost 'placeholder' explosion, it's incredibly anti-climactic, and leads to very little positive feedback for successfully pursuing said objective.

Now, again, I'm aware it's an early access game. But that's what makes the biggest complaint that people seem to be finding all the more disconcerting by its heavy-handed inclusion. You do not get access to the full initial campaign, or any but one of the co-op commanders, without spending money. For a game that's advertised itself as a return to the co-op and PvE experience of RTS past (notably Starcraft 2, and I'll get there), practically none of these aspects are in the current build of the game, and those that are are unpolished and lacking some rather crucial QoL. For Co-op, you get access to a single commander for free. A single race, when they've intentionally included three races in the game. Even the initial purchase of the cheapest supporter bundle only adds one more commander, and she's from the same race, so there isn't even a significant difference in playstyle. 

Second, the variety of co-op missions is heavily limited. To my knowledge after playing several days, I've only been placed in three different missions. I can't make any assumptions from this, as there's every possibility that the mission design team is the same that is working on the campaign, and Frost Giant is not a massive studio, but the combination of a heavily limited mission pool along with the inability to select specific missions leads to incredibly repetitive gameplay, as I've had runs of getting the same mission 3-4 times in a row on quickplay, while being locked into a single commander, as even though the others are available to test on, their later, more impactful unlocks, are not.

And here we run into where everyone and their partners have come to a crashing halt in the co-op system. There are, at this current stage, five available heroes. As stated, one of these comes free. Three of the others can be picked up in a bundle for... well, a lot of money, but all four of the remaining heroes are listed on the store. For ten dollars apiece. Now, I'm not unfamiliar with this sort of system. And as I said, we're getting back into SC2 territory here, because it's the easiest place to draw comparisons, and Frost Giant has been rather open about where they come from, and what their initial aspirations were for Stormgate. 

But SC2 did a few things different. Despite being Blizzard, despite hungering for money or whatever else you can say about that corporation, and despite them also having co-op commanders for sale, it felt... different. First and foremost, SC2 had several commanders that were free for all players of the game (if I'm remembering right, Raynor, Kerrigan, and Artanis), covering all three races in their most basic co-op iterations. Additional commanders were five dollars, and while yes, that's still money... it felt like you were getting something different out of each of them. They came with unique and thematic changes to the species, whether you were Zagara and just zerg-rushing the entire map with banelings, or Abathur, gathering essence to evolve your zerg into much stronger individual iterations, Dehaka with his feral zerg, Stukov and his zerg/terran hybrids... And that's just the zerg commanders, who all felt incredibly unique. 

Stormgate lacks any of this uniqueness. Partly because there just isn't a story there yet for two of the three races, and even the initial human story feels clunky and a heavy WIP, the characters just don't have a personality that would lead to this thematic differences in playstyle. Barricade plays, in my experience, functionally identical to Amara. Even the unique units that they get do not really change their playstyle by much. I can get a transport... or a transport that goes invisible. When there aren't any maps that require aerial transport for your units, this... doesn't change anything. Even Amara getting a vulcan with a flamethrower doesn't change the function of the unit. IT's still a front-ish line, stand in one place and fire at ground units unit. Now, I haven't unlocked up to maximum level in any of the commanders, but... none of the unlocks that I've seen, even at higher levels, promises any significant change to the playstyle. And considering I'd be paying 10 dollars for the privilege of unlocking more of the same feels incredibly awkward. 

In essence, it feels unfinished, which is to be expected, and the 'microtransactions' aren't really all that micro, and don't seem to offer much at all for the price. I'll still be keeping an eye on it, because... well, options for co-op and PvE focused RTS are limited out there in this day and age, but as it stands, I think I'm going to be putting it aside for a good long while.",1723652876,2024-08-14 12:27:56
steam,172118219,"This game has tons of potential! I think that there are valid criticisms about the game, but it should be noted that this is an early access game. Many may not remember how horrendous many aspects of Starcraft 2 or other great RTS games were in their closed early access, or even in their initial release (playing wings of liberty for example is substantially worse than playing stormgate in its current state). I think that the longer I've played the game, the more I have realized the direction the developers are taking the game design. A welcome change is an emphasis on longer battles which presents an opportunity to express more of your micromanaging skills. Importantly, this game removes many of the frustrating aspects of SC2 such as near instant/instant death that make SC2 too panicky for casual players. This team also listens very carefully to feedback, and as a result, investing your time into this game will allow you to shape its direction. This is a great feeling to have back within this genre.

I have yet to try the campaign and co-op missions as I am more of a competitive player, but this game definitely warrants a little bit of time for the game to ""click"", and, once it does, you might be as excited as I am : )",1723652630,2024-08-14 12:23:50

steam,172117674,"Another story about how former developers of the once-legendary games:""Starcraft II"" and ""Warcraft III"" left Blizzard to create their own game. Did they succeed in making a good product? Unfortunately, no. Just like with the former developers of ""Dead Space"" and their ""The Callisto Protocol,"" the result was a rather mediocre game that will always remain in the shadow of their previous work.",1723652049,2024-08-14 12:14:09
steam,172117339,"I was looking forward to this since the Kickstarter had gone live. I didn't back it though, and in hindsight, I am really fortunate that I didn't.

Because this game's major marketing point was that it is being developed by former Blizzard developers who worked on Starcaft 2, and that it was called ""the spiritual successor to SC2"", and how Frost Giant Studios also wants this game to be an eSport from Day 1, it deserves all the comparisons people have made between the two.

First of all, most notably the artstyle and presentation of this game are lackluster, even bad. Personally I'm not a fan of the ""clay-sculpture""-aesthetic they are going for, but also the character designs and unit designs look uninspired, bland and boring. Compared to SC2's units and characters, all this minute details to non-verbally communicate personality from this character or unit, Stormgate lacks all of these. The designs look ""safe"", as in too scared to do something different, outrageous or unique. They remind me more of the most generic aspects of League of Legends design, but much worse. 

Character models themselves are made with strange proportions (look up the orangutan meme), as well as the animation of these units and characters seem like they're unfinished. The characters' faces lack proper animation in cutscenes, where only the lips and eyes move, while everything else is static, making the characters look like they're either robots in flesh suits, or puppets hanging from strings. It all simply looks uncanny to me. In pre-mission briefings the characters even lack lip animation, where the head moves with the character, but nothing else. It is understandable that this is an early access release, but was proper facial animation too much to make into this? 

Unit animations too are lacking, hero units especially don't have animations for turning around, but instead will just flip instantly, when you want to move your hero unit from direction to direction. 

The first three missions, that are available on the free-to-play version are short and obviously work as tutorial missions for the new or returning players, while also introducing the main characters and opening the story from there. The plot of the game didn't hook me, but it could also be that it is a slow opening, and things would get better in the coming chapters, I can't say anything about that myself. The voice acting of the characters was alright, not bad but neither impressing. It was pretty fine, if not for the bad facial animation, or rather the lack of such. The tutorial itself was fine and explained the gameplay well, but I was left disappointed that there seemingly wasn't any separate tutorial for the two other races in the multiplayer, or any multiplayer tutorial at all. I could be mistaken however, if I just didn't find it from the main menu. 

I only played the singleplayer section of this game before writing this review, and I am yet to try the multiplayer. From what I've heard online, the MP seems alright, and quite similar to Starcraft 2. That leads me to my final observation: this game is almost exactly like Starcraft 2. It plays the same, with the very same three races, (Vanguard as the Terrans, Infernals as the Zerg, and Celestials as the Protoss), while different only to not be a total copy. It feels like an uninspired ripoff, rather than a ""Next-Gen RTS Experience"" as they promise on the Steam storepage. They really try to sell home the point that they're ""former Blizzard devs"" by seemingly trying to rip off their own work. When I thought of former Blizzard devs, I expected creativity and innovation, and not a copy - paste job. There is almost nothing ""next-gen"" about this game, expect for the Unreal Engine 5. In my own opinion, Starcraft 2, which originally release 14 years ago, looks (and also feels) much better than this game. Even though the graphics in SC2 may be a bit dated, the style, presentation, creativity and care to minute details elevates it higher for me than current Stormgate.

I know everything in early access is subject to change, but I expected more from a studio that promised so much, and with funding of 30-some million dollars. Of course they couldn't match the quality from Blizzard in its prime, but this isn't even close to the potential the SG has. It just seems like they mismanaged their funding and were forced to deliver something to the Kickstarter backers in order to complete their obligations, and double down on what they were able to produce so far, no matter the cost. The other alternative is that they took a look at this game they had developed, seriously observed and considered, and decided that it is ready for public release, and everything can be excused with ""it's just in early access"" and ""we're an indie studio"". The promotional material promised AAA and next-gen quality, and this is not it. 

Summa summarum, a great disappointment, and a waste of a first impression. I sincerely hope Frost Giant will get their stuff together, and deliver a much more polished and improved product in their 1.0 release, but so far you can find a much better sci-fi RTS game in Starcraft 2. It's free to play, and the story campaigns aren't very expensive during a sale. Until Stormgate fixes its problems, I cannot recommend it over a game that is over 14 years old, not to mention other competing RTS games like Company of Heroes 2, Age of Empires 2, etc.",1723651678,2024-08-14 12:07:58

Well, this is clearly not the work of Blizzard. It looks more like a homemade product of some students from Seoul.

Everything is bad in the game, the graphics, the strategic component, the missions that are not aimed at opening up showing what opportunities and what is the point of the buildings, what are the dependencies, but just some kind of crap b****

Just some kind of mush cutting of the models WC3 & SC3.

The hardware requirements are simply cosmic, with such requirements games like cyberpunk run on ultras And here is some soapy crap from ninety-eight

the most valuable thing here this game is that it was made by Blizzard employees, that's where the advantages end. A and another thing is that they let me try it for free so that I wouldn't spend money and then return it. Thank you very much for that.

steam,172115842,"Latest  Review

I played the free campaigns and it's ok, far far better than EA days. The game units and gameplay is nice feeling, very responsive but units still feel very safe. Art also got changes some for good some for bad. I think all factions require a consistency update. Everything looks like it's made from here and there, there is a conflict of old and new art.

Celestial require full on art update, infact remove them or add them and complete rework is required. celestial design is the worst in entire gaming.

I will still won't recommend this game for a purchase, but it's F2P. The AI skirmish is a complete scam. Played against normal AI, 2 mins into the match AI has entire army will all T2 units and a 2nd bse. The AI cheats, else play on stupid Easy mode.  In normal AI should not get any n=bonuses or advantages and should always play the player itself. Remove the auto charge and what not for production, keep charge only for Infernals. Remove the lancer and make the lancer a medic unit and Rifle should be the base unit.

Early Access review
This is a very inferior product. I get it they wanted to be the so called next-gen RTS and the next SC2 but people who already want SC2 can play that and those players will never ever play this game, especially when the game is of very inferior quality and makes a very bad first impression. Early access or not this not an excuse to deliver such a poor quality half-baked game.

On top of everything you have MTX with coop commanders. The coop commanders was made by blizzard to fund legacy of void as Activision was no more focusing on RTS and the dev team as a last ditch effort tried this idea and it worked in their favor but didn't make huge profit.

This entire studio promised they are going indie with fully funded startup so that they can make everything in their own freedom and not please shareholders and Activision overlords but this entire game is an antithesis of what this dev team bragged about.

Stop trying to make an existing game when your own product is not doing anything better than existing product. Not a single customer will use or buy your product if that is the case.

This game is not even early access ready and then they have this focus on E-sports. First of all not a single game in the world is made for E-sports, if so then that game will fail,If people liked the genuine and honest fun the product is giving they will play it spread the word and organically it will have a competitive scene. This is why this game fails at all pillars.

There is nothing exciting, artstyle is bland, unit designs are ugly AF, only good designs are those mechs with Gatling guns, Entire hellspawn faction is crap. They have Stitches at home which looks pathetic and doesn't suit the entire hell scene as it's bloated and putrid. In SC2 all Zerg has this carapace design and it looks like they all belong to one faction. The hellspawn even have Kodo beasts at home, the WC3 Kodo beast had personality, it had Cudding animation, the fat drummer has mini animations and all units had so much personality. Here they all stand like rubber dolls. The angel faction looks like Lego blocks and nobody can understand which is the head, feet or arm of these units they all look so bland there are no words. Protoss were such a cool design from zealots to the spaceship everything was top notch.

Hope this game fails and becomes a lesson to other studios that what an RTS should not be. I won't recommend this game even if you have some free time, better to sit idly and have digital detox than this pile of crap.

game needs a lot of work before its worth actually playing, feels like its still in an alpha state.

the art direction appears to mimic Overwatch from Blizzard. (i'm not a fan personally, but if you like that style it is what it is)

what happened to the days of paying for a game, and getting the game?
the free to play model needs to go as all it does it turn out slop.

bugs
-clicking the invite button on a friend more then once will send multiple invites to that friend, if you spam the invite it WILL continue to spam your friend and can force them to need to restart the game to do anything.

the menus need a LOT of work and look and feel like a game from the mid 90's. out dated and often buggy


if the developers grow a conscious and abandon the free to play model, get the game out of an alpha state, and make versatile and interesting gameplay instead of trying to make a discount store bin version of Starcraft/Warcraft love child with over inflated and egregious pricing model maybe could be enticed to change my review. but considering they decided this was a good direction to go in the first place shows that severe lac of understanding of the community.

the only hope for this game at this point is for the devs to create a campaign editor for the community to make up for a lac of creative vision and hope it sticks.

For more “review” for those foolish enough to doubt the insipid limits of these pretender developers, here is just a skosh of what you are in for. Demons telling you they are on humanitarian missions, and they are good beings because “they like the cycle,” a 1v1 experience that tries to be a hybrid of SC2 and WC3, with none of the artistry and fervor that went into the blizzard designs, experiences and all of the league of legends twitch reaction timing that clearly every gamer wants and thinks is the pinnacle of a strategy game (keep in mind, these servers and response times once you get over 150 supply TANKS, to the point you are guessing about were casts will land), a released in a paid Kickstarter service Co-Op experience that will more likely than not give you a fail on the mission and bug out even if you complete all objectives and defeat all enemy mobs on the map (played twice, once with a level 8 hero, who said the bugging issues were consistent, to be fair I don’t spend a lot of time on co-op), and I don’t think I need to exhaust anymore effort in explaining the horrendous campaign, from character design to story, to the total lack of effort in the… do we even call them cutscenes? Oh, and if you have not heard, the LITERAL change of there Kickstarter promises for all year 1 heroes to be included with the paid for campaign tier, only to have a DAY ONE EARLY RELEASE PAY FOR HERO…. Like, even if you are a SG stan, you cannot argue they did not LITERALLY screw over those who paid for the ultimate pack…

Look, if somehow, you as a human are still reading this and considering investing any time, let alone currency, on this game, all I can do is assure you that money would be better spent on anything…. Give it away, throw into the wind a fit of rage, burn in protest to consumerism, buy that ET game they buried in the desert it was so bad…. ALL more worth while and will fulfill you more as a human being. I mean, donate the money to a Super PAC. I think they are less evil and greedy than the people who run this business. They will not give you a positive experience. They will keep you strung along like a drug dealer promising a “coming soon ™” they do not own, have rights to, nor the ability to even fake replicate the legitimate hard work of others. These people are the equivalent to honor stealers in terms of military parlance. They quite often speak of there time as “developers” of SC2, and integral to the most successful RTS game in the history of gaming. These Losers did, at best, did some things to make co-op… that thing that was super popular, micro transaction heavy, and ultra repetitive and ultimately, unfun after more than 20 hours, or a hand full of hero levels.

steam,172108900,"The only thing innovative or next-generation about this game is its monetization strategy. This game may be made by former Blizzard devs, but not the good ones. This quality of game feels like its the devs behind the mess that was Warcraft III Reforged or the writers of WoW's ""morally grey"" Battle for Azeroth. 

This is a game designed for the multiplayer, and you can see that with their emphasis on unit control and trying to force feed an esports community into fruition. However, with that emphasis, I think they're going to miss out on creation of a fan base because the campaign is depressing and the content outside of PvP 1v1s or 2v2s is essentially non-existent.

The three prologue missions that are available at launch are the most uninspired story and bland dialogue missions I've ever played. There is no real story, simply reacting to things that the game tells you to care about. You learn nothing about the cast of characters introduced, nothing about who the factions available in the game are. You're hit with fantastic one liners such as ""that's a lot of parts"" when you see a pile of cars in a city. 

And this is supposed to make me want to pay $10 for the next 3 missions? And then $10 for the next 3 missions? And then $10 for the next three missions? Who thought splitting one faction's campaign into three different micro-transactions was a good idea? As a player, I would have maybe been more inclined to buy a campaign if I was actually getting the entire thing in one purchase instead of stringing me along to buy more and more with the prospect of an unfinished story. Honestly the three free prologue missions are a blessing, because they show what the value of the mission packs will be and I can safely assume I will regret paying $10 for three missions of similar quality.

Then you go to multiplayer just to be immediately met with a screen asking you to engage in even more transactions to unlock additional heroes. At this point, I Alt-F4'd and have no intention on giving the game a second chance unless they decide to make a real game in the next 2 years.",1723642798,2024-08-14 09:39:58
steam,172108804,"*LATEST 'OUT OF EARLY ACCESS Vanguard Campaign' Updated Review (8th Aug 2025 release)

Still a bit buggy, and easily my BIGGEST gripe with this game as a predominantly single player campaign gamer, is still a LACK of a basic manual save feature!

Overall the campaign is still light years better than initial early access version & only getting better with time, skirmish is fun, map editor has a lot of potential albeit still a work in progress, but already some amazing fan made mods & user levels created! 

I still think this game has A LOT of potential if it can get sustained sufficient fan & financial support. but I hope I'm wrong, but I have a bad feeling the developers shot themselves in the foot with over hyping this game of becoming the next Starcraft, and originally releasing it way TOO EARLY in such a patchy state, and creating a bad first impression. 

Is this game starcraft 2? No it isn't, but it I highly doubt we'll ever get the same AAA RTS budget starcraft 2 game again with previous budget, let alone a proper Starcraft 3 sequel from Activision-Blizzard. 

FrostGiant is an indie small startup studio with obviously a much, much  smaller budget & personnel than typical AAA publishers eg Activision-Blizzard, EA & Microsoft etc. if you expected production value on same level as Starcraft 2, you're kidding yourself. Yes Starcraft 2 was made a long time ago, but point is it had a massive publisher & developer behind it when RTS genre was still mainstream, RTS is a very niche genre now - so times have changed & I think people really need to have more realistic expectations.

More importantly Stormgate is fun, and after competing the campaign, it's solid without being amazing. 1on1 competitive online is relatively smooth (though I usually get smashed in few competitive online games i've playerd), custom vs AI is fun, the map editor has MASSIVE potential

if Stormgate can survive this tough period, it's got a very promising future with lots of potential, if all the haters don't end up killing off this promising franchise & scaring off future investor and companies in bothering to try revive RTS genre by risking making new RTS IPs.

*UPDATED REVIEW (since April 2025 0.4.0 updated patch): 
Stormgate is 10 x better now with completely overhauled campaign, character models, and more appropriate darker and more mature art style and overall presentation. I'd HIGHLY recommend giving SG a 2nd chance, especially after impressive total revamps made under patch 0.4.0. This is even only going to get better with time & further patches and updates!

*ORIGINAL REVIEW (based on initial July 2024 early access release, post AUG 6th Aug 2025 release)
obviously Stormgate is still in very early access status. I personally am not a fan of the cartoony art style (but am willing to look past this, if rest of the game engages me), and generic writing and story in campaign to date. 

However I see great potential in this new RTS game and franchise, with its unique hybrid sci-fi & fantasy settingand great sound track, especially with the Celestial Armada's theme music. 

It's clear FrostGiant team have great passion for reviving RTS genre & when playing this you need to remember Frostgiant are a new relatively small new studio compared to Blizzard, and had a tiny fraction of the budget & time to make this game compared to Starcraft 2 and warcraft 3. 

I think it's best to go into this game looking at the bigger picture and to see Stormgate as it's own new RTS game and franchise, rather than comparing it to Starcraft 2 or Warcraft 3. 

Stormgate is hopefully start of many new RTS games such as Tempest Rising, Zerospace, Immortal Gates of Pyre etc to lead to a revival of the RTS genre, but none of these smaller independent developers will have AAA massive budget that Blizzard and EA had allocate to SC, WC and C&C in the late 90s and early 2000s when RTS games were a much bigger and mainstream genre.

So overall Stormgate is quite bare bones right now being in early access, but I can see very early promising signs that this game can really kick on to become a great new established RTS IP and hopefully revive the RTS genre. 

I won't pass my final judgement on Stormgate till early access is finished in at least a year's time & Stormgate reaches 1.0 stage. I have relatively high hopes FrostGiant can continue fine tuning & further developing this new game & franchise and with ongoing polish and work and listening to constructive fan feedback, I can't wait to see the final outcome in another year or so! 

As a predominantly single player campaign person myself, please be aware the single player campaign seems to be behind all other modes e.g. 1 vs 1, co-op etc in development, so if you're wanting a polished single player campaign, you may need to wait a bit longer until Frostgiant add a lot more polish to this mode. 

HOwever 1 on 1 mode is in much better state & units are very responsive, and it's quite easy & fast to link into a competitive game!

Overall if you're a genuine RTS fan & wish to support the revival of this once popular genre, and play a game that has great potential, albeit in early stages of its development - IMHO I'd definitely recommend checking Stormgate out, taking into account the caveats I mentioned above",1723642709,2024-08-14 09:38:29

To me the overall gameplay is good and fun, only downside are the lack of heroes in 1 v 1, it feels like the units are left by theirselves and that there is not that ""main leader"" to carry the team 

Lags/ screen stuck = Terrible, this is the point that makes me not recommend this game, it says that I have played 5.1 hours on this game but in reality i spent 4 h getting stuck on different screens or in game, and only 1 hour of real gameplay.

For me none of the mission work. and when playing 1 v 1 in either custom game against a bot or the regular 1 v 1 against a real player, the lags are unbearable, 2 times out of 3 as soon as an ennemy unit appears the screen got stuck for a while making it impossible to move your units around or seeing anything. 
Also sometimes the screen get stucks on the loading page just before the match starts and it counts as one loss. 

in short, I think this game could be good but because of the lags it makes it impossible to enjoy it. 

I understand that they need tester, and they did pull out other version before this one, but seeing these amount of lags/ bugs just makes me wonder what they are trying to achieve ? disgust anyone that could be inetrested in playing this game ?",1723641664,2024-08-14 09:21:04

steam,172107260,"mission 1 :
-basic controls not working (ctr + 1 to make a group. you actually have to remap every shorcut if you want htem to work and don't have an us keyboard).

-pnj/units stat interface is to rework. it's so little in the middle of all + you have to highlight it to see upgrades ? or I missed something maybe.

-object interface is to rework (flavor text first, no stat shown, (= unequip to reequip to know what it does (with a stat hud to highlight as well)).

-way too much elite/hero units in mission 1. One is more than enough. we can feel the ""buy me"" intention way stronger than the ""I'm a important character to the story"" side. in fact they all seem non-relevant. even the starter one. I mean Jim raynor had more introduction through mission 1 description (which is not even 1 line-short, but at least we know he is a sheriff and try to save its community so is implicated) than this ""amara"" (we do undertsand she doesn't feel implicated as the LAST sentence of the mission, before that...nothing).

-water light reflect effect way too strong, we can't see a thing half of mission 1. there is no option for light effect on water, only general lighting but it doesn't change the ratio ""water in your face vs where are my units"".

mission 2: 

-rather ok. introduction to base building. actually maybe a little too simple considering the next one. it could have been nice to use this mission to learn more buildings/units.

mission 3:

-can be tedious for a new player. actually you have to defend your position but can't bunker in it since you also have to free points and clean all bases to stop the non-stop attack. many new building and mechanics come in this map as well so learning is a bit tedious. I advice to clean a few spot first to calm the game and before running out of ressources before ""pausing"" to learn new things.

-also this is where for me the game started showing very poor performance. a LOT of lag can occur when attacking a base and you don't understand a word of what they say because of that as well. it might be the limit for my processor, I only have a gen7 but it's 4Go so more than recommanded and working at 100%. graphic is 4060 and run à 45% so it's ok, 32 ram seems sufficient as well. also strangely trying to limit the fps in options made the game with even more stutter on the overall so I had to let it on ""unlimited"" despite the fact it's already limited by the graphic card.

after that:

- 10e/$ for 1 mission (yes only 1) amongst 3 mission (so 30e/$) for 1 race is way too high.
they do promise 3 missions per race (so 6 more). official campaign overall price = 90e/$ for 9 missions (+ the free 3 for intro). and the first map as still in beta and sold full price... hum...


afterall effect: 

buy it at your own appreciation, and do the free missions first to see if your computer has better performance (especially the 3rd mission, build as much units as you can first to stress-test your computer on large scale base battle).
imo it does still need some work. cinematics without game models, some graphics options not working, a lot of lag as I said, and it's very expensive if you want to play the campain and are not attracted by the pvp side of it.
also I have to admit it's still ugly. at least for a 2024 game. sc2 still looks way better.",1723641020,2024-08-14 09:10:20

steam,172104513,"Early Access is not the problem neither is an excuse for this product. Palword, Godsworn, Baldurs Gate 3,  Mechabellum, Last Epcoh and many many others are an example of what a good Early Access should be. 

What Frostgiant does is a shameless money grab. Kickstarted for a game that had enough funding to be released any way, then packages of 25, 40 and even 60 EUR for 2 weeks early start on an Early Access that looks like Alpha version. And on top of that you need to buy more heroes 10 EUR each? How much more can you feed on nostalgia and""fear of missing out"" ?

They chanted for months how this will be the next generation strategy, successor of StartCraft / Warcraft from ex-Blizzard devs. All so they can gather money from Kickstarter and pre-purchases for an unfinished product. And now with between 40 and 50% negative reviews they repeat in every post and video ""but we are an Indi company, this is Early Access, show some understanding"", Well, don't put your fans in a situation in which they are 300+ USD deep in a Alpha version game and still are asked to pay more in future to get key content like missions and heroes.

My criticism isn't only the Blizzaed-like greed.
As the majority has already said - [b]the art is awful[/b]. Your most dedicated fans are 30+ even 40+ years old now. You expect them to like units that look like toys??? HOW?? For who is this? 10 year old future RTS fans that have 5 second tic-tok attention span?  You received the first feedback for the art years ago and nothing is changed. Look how the units in [b]Immortal: Gates of pyre[/b] look. This is the art style that everybody wants! Or look what only 2 developers are doing with Godsworn and then ask for 60 EUR ultimate edition.

The campaign, for which you charge money in EA is a shameful disgrace. Poor unimaginative story with awful models. The quality on some places is close to Heroes of might and magic V (released 2006) campaign.

Even basics like unit movement is so bad. Units constantly block each other. If I don't micro manage my army all the time it is a total mess. Range units go away from the battle in an attempt to move forward... somehow !?? Mele units not attacking...

And in the end what are the new mechanics and creative ideas that will take RTSes to the next evolutionary stage? Central menu for building and units - great! Some creativity in one of the factions- grea!. But that is not enough. Instead of 2-3 examples we wanted the whole game to feel new and fresh. Otherwise we will continue to play StarCraft 2 and Warcraft 3.

AI is totally brain dead. Vanguard Bot has 4 bindings and sends packs of 10 units 20+ minutes into the game. Next gen for sure. 

We expected EA to be for refining things, getting the campaign finished and improving the graphics. Instead it seems to be about developing the rest 60-80% of the game.

You intentionally set the expectations super high so that you can earn some money early on. 

The ones who are most happy with the current state of your projects are those who have 500+ games already and get to beat the noobs who joined now and didn't give 25+ EUR two weeks ago. Thanks for that btw. The casual players like me and just disappointed and repelled from your greed. If I was totally wrong you wouldn't have Early Acces launch with 4k people for a free game.

I hope you will succeed with 1.0. There is a whole year tyo change your ways and become more humble.

steam,172104054,"Frost Giant Studios advertises this game as ""a RTS of the next Generation"".
To fullfill this claim in my eyes Stormgate should be better than existing RTS in almost all aspects. 

After trying Stormgate out I can say its not even close.. 
The only thing Stormgate has got going for it are some small QoL improvements such as easier structure building (because you dont have to select a worker) or good and logical initial hotkey mapping.

Everything else is extremely lackluster:

- Graphics are awful and worse than SC2, especially terrain, unit models and animations. 
- UI is extremely flavorless and barebones
- Audio design is not good
- Campaign seemed okay, but felt more like something like SC1 instead of ""next gen""
- Coop is not at all fleshed out, progression is lackluster and non-transparent 
- Monetisation is an insult with extreme pricetags on missions and coop commanders - coop commanders being twice as expensive as in SC2 (you cant even try out all races in coop without spending money!) and mission packs costing 10 dollars for 3 missions. Just imagine how much the SC2 campaign would cost if monetised this way.

By proclaiming this game as some ""next gen RTS"" genre-saving thing Frost Giant set it up for failure.
Thats underlined even further by keeping the design extremely close to SC2 and WC3 (3 races, demon zerg, angel protoss, creeping, coop commanders).
Comparisons to those games are guaranteed to be made and Stormgate does not live up to those high standards.

Some people may say the game is just in early access and things can improve.
I dont doubt that the game will improve in some aspects, but some things are simply too far off for it to ever be rightfully called a real ""next gen RTS"" .

The company's financials are not doing well, and you should be cautious about getting into a game that may shut down in couple of months, if not weeks.

With that out of the way, let's do a fresh review for the 1.0 launch

Pro -> 
-Visually decent
-Smooth control and good control scheme

Con ->
-Most of everything is subpar.
-From faction design (global abilities are not particularly interesting)
-Stormgate mechanics is interesting but repetitive very quickly.
-Unit design, while visually better, the interaction is just boring. There is no interesting micro like sc2, and lacking any strategic depth like AOE, and missing fun factor like WC3.

I admittedly do not really engage with 1v1, but from the perspective of the rest of the game, it all just feels like a soulless cash grab. Game is designed to milk every cent possible for playtime for modes that are not 1v1. Paywalls on paywalls, and a campaign that I swear gave me nonstop WC3 flashbacks for narrative, but at a much worse quality. 

To me the worst thing is the problems the game has don't really seem like the kind of problems likely to be resolved. We already have set the standard of campaign chapters being 3 missions of varying length. Mission chapters in the future absolutely will release behind massive paywalls, indicated by the crazy over-inflated prices of coop commanders. 

I will state it plainly, this game is not better than SC2. The campaign is worse and is being released in a boring, monetization-first fashion, and the coop is simply not finished or well thought out. Even if the 1v1 is good, the 1v1 is fine in SC2, the other content was Stormgate's chance to really shine.

This is in Early Access. [b]After[/b] a ""successful"" crowdfunding campaign and paid early access / beta cycles. And frankly if it's available for purchase, that's just a product you are selling as a company, no matter how much you want to excuse yourself with ""but it's early access"".

And wow does this hit not a single mark. Still playing it of course, but from what I can already tell:

* Graphics are surprisingly bad for a modern game. It looks works than indie unity games that also go for a simplified artsy style such as Against The Storm. It looks worse than Starcraft 2 itself does, while also having less of a visual identity.
* Sound is [b]horrendous[/b]. Not a single level is mixed correctly. Recording fidelity is all over the place. Music is unfitting. Voice-overs are wrong (as in, the words are there but they don't react to the situation the line goes with). Volumes are essentially random. What happened with this particular point? I'd rather have no sound and just a ""still working on it""-notice, tbh. This actively grates while playing and turning it off genuinely makes it better. Huge shame, considering how much RTSes gain from good audio.
* Animations are extremely unfinished and unpolished. Assuming they're all still being worked on, fine, they're usable for now. But the game is in early access, it's supposed to be well past this stage in the development process. Characters sliding around in cutscenes, WC3-era animations for units in said cutscenes, this all does not look like a game you want to release in 2024. At all.
* The campaign (what I've tried so far) is the usual stuff. It's not bad, but it's also nothing good. The inventory system is neat but the UI looks like it was made for a wholly different game, in particular once you start picking up data pads and get voice interactions.

What's annoying is for a game that's [b]at best[/b] something between a tech demo and an alpha build (nevermind being feature complete), pay-us-please buttons are everywhere. The game wears its fleecing nature openly, and proudly so. Multiple crowdfunding systems + mass-payment F2P. 10€ for each co-op hero? I don't think so, devs!

Huge shame. I'll try the other game modes of course, but right now I have exactly zero hope this is worth the price asked. As a free game. Your time is better spent on a heap of other games. And this just makes you grab the free parts of SC2, which are a) more and b) better.

Alright, no, I give up. Could not even make it one hour in. It's just [b]too[/b] rough, unpolished and frankly unfinished.

steam,172099639,"Disclaimer: I am an ultimate edition founder from Kickstarter, so I did get the chance to play during the closed betas before, though the betas I participated did not include campaign or coop, which is what this review will mostly be about.
[i]Comments are on, I love to hear your feedback, but please behave.[/i]

Since I don't think this game really needs much of an introduction I'll skip that part and move on straight to [b]my issues with Stormgate[/b]:

[b]Easy-Anti Cheat[/b]
Stormgate makes use of EAC, something which was never communicated before that it would be the case until it was dropped on us fait accompli with the advanced early access launch in early August.
EAC is a kernel-level anticheat, which is quite problematic, not just according to myself, but also according to much more knowledgeable people. I won't go into the details here since this is a review of Stormgate and not a ""Why giving Kernel lvl access to stuff that doesn't really need it isn't a good idea"" PSA, but if you aren't aware I'd highly recommend you to inform yourself.

[b]Warz[/b]
Warz is a coop hero (alike coop commanders in SC2) who was released as day 1 DLC for 10$. However the Kickstarter FAQ stated that founders would receive all year 0 heroes as part of their founder's bundle. This has since been edited out (Source 1) and of course you could now make the argument that Warz could count as a ""year 1"" hero - but I feel like this is being overly charitable towards FG, something I had been in the past since I bought into their ""we couldn't do what we wanted to do with SC2 in ActiBlizz"" stick, but this is clearly undeserved.
We (the founders) are apparently slated to become a ""replacement hero"" down the line to make up for it, but to me this has set a precedent to not take anyhting from FG at face value - and neither should you.

[b]Always Online[/b]
While this isn't too surprising, considering SG being a F2P game, not being able to have offline skirmishes or play the campaign offline is definitely a bummer. In difference to other points I made here this certainly is among the weakest ones, but I still want to point it out.
What makes this point unfortunately a good bit stronger that I repeadetly experienced lagg during campaign play while my PC was running fine otherwise and internet was working well outside of this, too. IDK if this is because of EAC, because of bad netcode or whatever, but experiencing lagg during campaign sessions certainly is a new kind of frustrating.

[b]The campaign[/b]
At the time of writing we currently have access to the first 6 missions of the campaign, and I cannot help but to call it ""The Force Awakens"" of Blizzard RTS - our (so far) main character is fem Arthas, hunting for definitely-not-frostmourne while being motivated by a loved one (her dad) having died to the initial assault of the not-scourge/zerg with an opening cinematic of her looking at a picture of him that really reminds one of the SC2 opening cinematic of how Raynor stared at the picture of Kerrigan.
And I could go on about this - somehow, even though we just have 6 missions released at this point. So far I experienced next to nothing that would feel original and I can [i]really[/i] not recommend paying money for this.
Also one other thing I have to point out is that based on what I understand the ""cinematics"" at this point - except for the very first one - are using the ingame models and it shows. This however is - also as far as I understand - supposed to change and just an ""early access feature"".

[b]Overall while you certainly can go and check the game out - it's F2P afterall - I cannot recommend you to invest too much into it unless you are here for the PVP.[/b]

Old Review:
Okay here comes finaly the real review after being hard stuck on the loading screen for multiple hours i want to say anything about this game. 
for most people stop telling others that they shouldnt hate the game because they want proper campaing, coop, and other good modes. 
The delevopers only made the 1v1 game mode and it looks terrible for now because the game wont be able to live only with death match 1v1.
 
The Coop: 10 euro for a comander? excuse me, but as i know i can buy 2 comanders for 10 euro in starcraft 2 and they will be better and more entertaining. 

Not really original: some characters look like they are taken from other games like for example the monster who looks like the Abonamation from WC3 has the same walking animation as Butcher from Heroes of the storm the Diablo monster. For some reasone we have Tracer Shadowsong, and i mean black colored tracer with blink and ability which looks like Fan of knifes, but retarted, 
the models looks like they are made for Overwatch or even worse Mobile game everything looks really disgusting, a woman who is made to look really beutiful in the drawing looks so ugly in the animations, she have really muscular hands more muscular than what the men might have and for some reasone her wrist Muscles is bigger than her Biceps. 
most of the characters in the animations have really terrible animated mouth opening or weird moves as if im watching the SC brood wars animations. 
the game is like the entire thing is multiplayer no pause no save, you have codex to read with really terrible jokes in them and and feels useless you cant even read it properly because the game dosent have a pause! :O

Tracer shadowsong: this character is so ugly in with that model in the drawings she looks good tho. 
her personality is so weird, she sounds as she has AI voice or she really has. just the lack of emotion in her is so annoying. and i think she became the next Arthas too fast. The devs probably will never get original.

the pickable items: they are really boring imagine giving heroes inventory to pick items and they arent entertaining. The good thing in Warcraft 3 was that it gives you to build Maiev despite her being agility hero you build her like a spell caster. Warcraft reforged fixed the first two sections of the campaings in a good way making the arthas campaing entertaining. 

In the first: you build arthas like a tank streght hero which was harder in the classic warcraft 3 because of the lack of items in it. 

The second section: the undead campains. They even gave you to play Sylvanas after you kill her and that was cool because she was more uniqe hero instead of weak banshee unit.  
even the guy who makes Re-reforged made more than the entire group of 60 devs and he did it for free!
the last thing that i have to say for now. Starcraft 2 got its campaing expansions first. and then it got the multiplayer, since the campaing came first they were really well polished and entertaining, but in storm gate the thing that came first was 1 map coop and 3 maps for death match 1v1 really terrible move.
With that said i think the game could have a better future, but not that way!
i will make updates if i remember other things i could say, but for now i think i said enough. 

update: is anybody else hard stuck in loading screen even after trying multiple ways to make the loading screen finaly load? 

update on the review after using hotspot to enter in the game, i finaly managed to see the game and im disapointed. i remember them telling us that we will get the frist comanders from every faction for free. the only thing i got for free was the palandin guy the rest cost money, 
only half the campaings are free as well 
but still if i try to load with my internet nothing will happeni will still be hard stuck on the loading screen for conecting me with my steam profiel

steam,172098295,"The game might be a ""spiritual successor"" to Starcraft II, in that the micromanagement is through the roof. Almost every unit has a unique active ability, graphically it is difficulty to tell what is going on in combat. The game was designed to be some boring e-sports made for professional South Korean gamer, not for the average Joe that just wants to get online, and go through a rock-paper-scissors style macro RTS. The campaign seems cliche and boring, the characters are unlikable dis-interesting tropes. I don't know what this game is trying to be other than a storefront for micro-transactions.",1723629463,2024-08-14 05:57:43
steam,172097892,"I am a long time W3 & SC2 fan and a founder for this game.

Initially, this game looked absolutely horrible. Its art style felt like it was a low budget indie game composed by interns. I did not have any expectations from this game, but Frostgiant took criticism to heart. They replaced the art director and made MASSIVE changes to the art style, essentially overhauling it. 

Now, as of update v0.3, game looks incredible. There are still PROBLEMS with the game. My main criticism is that they focused too much on balance and too little on fun. A game should be fun to play first and foremost. For me, that involves interesting mechanics like leveling & itemizing your heroes. But since Frostgiant has shown that they are willing to listen and make massive changes according to feedback, I'm leaving a positive review in support of them.

As a thought experiment, I think spontaneous events that randomly or at specific times happen on map would elevate the game and encourage fighting. IMO HotS does this very well. Could be interesting expriment to expand the game design beyond that of traditional RTS'es

About microtransactions; They are perfectly fine. People are making too big of a deal out of it. There is no scummy microtransaction in game (no loot boxes or chance based items). You get exactly what you pay for. This is completely acceptable on a F2P base game. They need to make money somehow.",1723628812,2024-08-14 05:46:52

steam,172097359,"played this game 12 hours now and still stand by this review ^^:
Honestly, the game is perfectly fine, I didn't back them up because I didn't trust the ""We come from blizzard, trust the me bro"". But I'm loving it so far. I waited until this game was free before playing it. And just finished the prologue (free part of the campain). Really liked it. I'll be purchasing the first part of the campain this evening. 

Furthermore I've played the co-op mode with my friend (you can play without a third person) last evening and we had a blast, we lost everything on beginner mode lol. So taking on those mission with just the two of us learning the game was a bit hard. But we'll get better, like we did in Star craft 2 (brag part: got 2 max prestiged characters, and my meta-lvl was 70). 

I love the way they monetized this game, everything seems to be a one time purchase, where you get wat you buy. (10 euro for 3 campain missions is a bit on the steep side though). Since we just tested the co-op mode yesterday, we also checked some other commanders. You can play them for a bit (at least) before purchasing them (like sc2). So that was nice. 

For the players coming from SC2 (my fellow casuals). This game isn't the same, so expect to become a noob again. I'll definitely will have fun learning Stormgate. 

To the developers: I hope you'll continue to add more maps and commanders (in co-op mode). (I really liked the prestige system from sc2 aswell, don't know if that is in Stormgate). 

To the pvp community: Sorry I don't play pvp so this is a worthless review for you guys. Have fun.",1723627963,2024-08-14 05:32:43
steam,172096981,"Still only played about a dozen or so games but I like what I see so far.  The Free to Play covers 1v1s, custom games, co-op and a sample of the campaign.  Stormgate combines features from many popular RTS games.  The units are responsive and very microable, the upgrades add an extra layer of strategy but also feel pretty intuitive.  Most of the units will have familiar mechanics if you play other popular RTS games, and the tech trees are not terribly complicated and feel well thought out and impactful.


I especially like the very microable units in a game with less lethality than SC2.  Even though Starcraft has some of the most microable units in the genre, it is stressful as heck because so many units can die in under a second.  Stormgate seems to have found a much more pleasant balance to strike with  tactical advantages being meaningful but not so sudden that you have no opportunity to respond.  Units are tactically powerful AND they have strong counterplay.

Most of the things that need improving are exactly the things you would expect in early access: better graphics and optimization are in progress, and the game balance is mostly okay but needs a few tweaks still.


The only thing I didn't like was the pricing of the extras and stuff, but you can play everything you could in SC2 for free, so there isn't any need to buy anything AT ALL OR EVER.  So I'm still on board.",1723627361,2024-08-14 05:22:41

I played mostly the coop mode to see, and it was bad, really bad.

Went back and tried starcraft 2 again just to be sure, and everything just plays and feels and reacts 10x better. Audio, visuals, ui reacts to what you do etc, everything just feels so good and clean after having tried stormgate.

Examples of problems, all these adds up making the game frustrating to play:

- Construction orders are often ignored, around half the expansions I scheduled got canceled and the building was never built.

- There is almost no audio feedback for attacks and kills.

- Click hitboxes are bad, often times it is hard just to click on the thing you want.

- There is no audio for confirming actions (or it is basically silent or undiscernable, hard to tell), combined with unreliable actions and hard to click on what you want and you have a frustrating time just playing the game. In starcraft 2 everythign just does what you want.

- You get notifications all the time, but spacebar doesn't take you to them so really hard to tell where they are.

- Resource display aren't on the edge of the screen ui as in every other strategy game ever made, instead it is on top of the command panel.

- Map is really hard to read, structures are often tiny dots.

- In some coop maps enemy stats just scales up with duration, they don't make the attacks bigger its just suddenly all enemies deals hundreds of damage to ensure you lose. Even a timer would have been much better, the only thing telling you this happens is a voice line ""enemy is getting prickly"", not clear at all that means enemies now deal hundreds of damage killing everything you have instantly.

Edit 2 (March 8, 2025): From the perspective of someone who plays Celestials more often, the macro mechanics of Celestials feels a little less gimmicky and more consistent now, but I'm still flabbergasted whenever I am forced to use the Quick Macro button to build buildings when my Arcship is being upgraded. It just feels so inconsistent and off. Why not just allow the build key even when Arcships are being upgraded since you can do it with Quick Macro anyway? Or, although this would be a nerf, make it so that you need to have at least one Arcship that is not being upgraded in order to use the Quick Macro key for buildings?

If they released the exact same game, but saying ""Here's where we at now, please tell us what you liike, what we can improve"", I'm sure the Early Access release would have done a lot better.

That said, I've followed the game devs for years now and I completely trust that they know how to make a great game. They are very transparent in their dev blogs, they listen to their players' feedback, tthey have a great game design philosophy and they know how to make something fun, even if it takes several iterations.

Got to max level in co-op for 1 commander (previous beta)

I really enjoy the game. I am mainly a 1v1 player, and I love solving interesting problems in the meta such as how to defend cheese and timing attacks.  I primarily play as macro with cheese strats being less than 5% of my total games.  

I can see the game succeeding or failing depending on how they approach balance and marketing issues.
I do agree they have over hyped the game, and it will take time to deliver on their promises.  Many people here don't really understand how development works and except too much in a short time.  They have no idea how much things costs.   A lot of their criticisms are valid but many lack any degree of rationale.  You should judge the game based on what you would expect to see, given the development time, budget, and company history.   

This is a new company, with start up costs, trying to make a game with a lot of scope, in a short of time a time as possible.  They have high goals.

Some Bad:
They should of did a better job communicating expectations, and managing hype.  A lot of people are salty because of it.  Frost Giant expected their audience to be more mature about things, but that is always wrong in the online world.  So they are part to blame for that.

They are very transparent with how they are working and on development, and that is used to draw ridiculous conclusions and used against them.   Sadly, this response will make other developers less likely to want to be transparent, and potentially Frost giant also in the future.

They are working on too many features in parrallel.  They should of just worked on 1v1 and co-op.  Made sure those are really really strong, and waited on campaign.  Maybe develop campaign on a separate build under NDA. 

It's a sad story, Frost Giant tried to give us something early to play with, to make us happy.  Include us on their development, listen to and respond to feedback.  Extended and lifted NDA's early, tried to attract people outside the community with ads, and breath life into this dead genre.  Yet so many people acting like the game is the worst thing they ever played, will never get better and no one should give it a chance.

Anyways, The game isn't that bad, if you don't like it now, come back in a few months or tune into the news. When it reaches a fidelity that you like, that is the time to enjoy it.

then set aside the fact that discussions which even [i] dare [/i] question the character cast and the writing get deleted in the  steam discussions, and people who post anything in that regard get permabanned from the dev studio's discord, no matter if they actually backed the game on kickstarter and bought premium packages here on steam... as some discussions put it, if they haven't been deleted yet like a number of others, who are they making this game for? its free to play yet the primary focus of theirs is esports 1v1? seriously? who made that decision? are masses always interested in esports? is the casual player salivating over the prospect of cash prize tournaments, confident in their own skill?

at the least the focus should have been on co-op and campaign first, esports later when its fleshed out, but i suppose that approach was blocked when frostgiant took circa 20 million usd as funding for the game. from south korea. the notoriously non-esports country.

to have secured 60 million dollars total as funding for this game yet come out with just this after two years... i am not a developer of games, but consider that wc3 took 4 years to make (started 1998, announced 1999), technology has advanced since then a lot, and yet the game looks, plays, runs, AND storytells way worse? its like it does not have a soul, its like everyone who works at post-activision purchased blizzard starts losing parts of their soul as time goes on, so that even if they go elsewhere afterwards they are unable to recreate what they once could in the past..

maybe, just maybe this will turn out way better in 1.0, considering at the time of writing this is 0.0.0.1 or something along those lines, and there are glimpses of things that look good in co-op, such as the..abyss? gates map, and the moba-like wave push co-op map, but it will take way more than that to shine through its currently destroyed goodwill which is being destroyed still mind you by backers and premium package purchasers not even owning all day 1 content, campaign missions costing money per mission, and co-op commanders costing 10 dollars per, with only 1 being free, so much for variety. if there is one thing you never want to lack in a f2p game, its variety.

i digress, it is possible this game makes a bounce back, but unless these visuals get changed, the cardboard copy reign of chaos storyline revitalized and de-globalized (strong independent man-like female protagonist who doesnt need no man and talks down to everyone), i dont see how will this stick around for as long as sc2's co-op did. yes, i think sc2's co-op alone will outlive this game unless they start taking it seriously and stop approaching the customerbase like it lives in some urban area in usa and has hundreds of dollars spare, has no regard for any subliminal political messaging, and has no quality standards.

i'd give this game a mixed due to my benefit of the doubt, for now, but its not an option.",1723613648,2024-08-14 01:34:08
steam,172088761,"Going into this I was expecting a 5/10

The game did not disappoint. It really is the epitome of basic bitch RTS. There is nothing next gen about it. Graphically, aside from high poly count, some games from 2008 look better. DirectX 12 my ass. Gameplay wise, it’s basically just Starcraft 2, with a tiny bit of Dawn of war in the sense you capture points across the map for bonuses and bounty from creep kills.(they removed the camps now)

What does the game do well though. I appreciate that your workers aren’t completely vulnerable to rushes, they are fairly durable and take time to kill, you can bring in reinforcements to assist, and the workers can drive off small attack forces, although if they are fighting, they aren’t harvesting so it’s probably game over anyway, but hey, it could be worse. The standardized keybinds are an okay idea, you press Q to bring up your entire build menu, select your structure and place it, a worker will be assigned to build it. That slightly reduces the micromanagement required. But there are no innovations beyond that.

However, it is still a classic base building RTS, and no matter what you do, the game will always be about Actions Per Minute(APM), maximizing efficiency, and ridiculous multitasking. It doesn’t matter how you try to simplify it, it may not be as sweaty as Starcraft 2, but it ain’t far behind. Constantly having to switch back and forth between micromanaging your forces, checking your factories and making sure production keeps up with your resource income, and having to make snap decisions with your resources, expanding or upgrading n such. These things detract from the fun, always.

There isn’t much in the way of battlefield tactics, as far as terrain is concerned, there is high ground, choke points, and LOL grass to hide in. The combat almost can’t be simpler. It really is an average RTS. “Ex-Blizzard” should be it’s own tag at this point, as all they ever make are Diablo or Starcraft clones.

Somethings about this game really irritate me, like the lack of a formation system, your soldiers just clump up tightly, which makes them vulnerable to AOE and artillery. Or say you have a mixed force of melee and ranged units, with a formation system like in Warcraft 3, your melee guys will be out in front, always. But in this game, they will likely intermix, so as you engage the enemy, your melee troops that are in front go in, and as the rangers engage, they stop and shoot, forming a wall that the melee troops behind them must run around, so you don’t hit with everything at once, and it can screw you over. Warcraft 3 has a formation system, and that game is 22 years old…I dunno, maybe that won’t work well with this game, where the maps are just claustrophobic and ranges are so short.
Also, due to the lack of a formation system, if you have slower units, they always lag behind, so you can't keep your forces together. If that ever causes issues, make it so you can disable the formation mode. Again, Warcraft 3 did it 22 years ago.

I thought about what may be able to improve the game, and honestly, I don’t think anything can. This style of RTS, the Classique base building RTS is just over, this type of game has absolutely run its course. Every now and then someone comes along trying to revitalize RTS genre, and they always fall short, this game included. As many reviewers point out, why play this game over the others(except that it’s free I guess), there isn’t a reason, and they likely can’t add one considering how simple the mechanics are.

I’ll probably play a little more and may revise the review

After playing a little more, it isn't any better. When you play a match, its always about getting the resource advantage, killing creep camps is essential for the bounty. Once you have the resource advantage, you don't even need to tech up anymore, you can just overwhelm your enemy with sheer numbers, and there ain't shit they can do about it. This is of course always the biggest problem with this style of resource gathering, base building RTS. Once you get the resource advantage, it's game over. Since it's hard to deny early expansions, you pretty much always have to outplay your opponent on the field, but what does that even look like? Picking people off at range and kiting works, but as the combat mechanics are just so simple, there doesn't seem like much more to it than that.

Another thing I dislike, is the god powers that each faction has, The vanguard for example can promote their soldiers magically, through the power of magic. I despise these god mode powers, its one of those things you have to always keep in mind, so more multi tasking, and gives you undue influence of the battlefield that is just omnipresent.

I can't imagine anything that could even make this game better than a 5/10
Hold up...I actually can, Here's the problem, I play Vanguard; and the other problem is that if I get a resource advantage, I can just spam Exos and win the day, there is no point what so ever in teching up, that's because higher tier units are just weak. So I suppose we need stronger high tech units, and maybe, we can get better variety in the game. Maybe this game can reach it's height, of being a 6/10 game

But if someone is on the backfoot in the early game, how can they possible turn things around, that's another problem.",1723613568,2024-08-14 01:32:48

steam,172088384,"Absolutely not worth it for players who just like to play campaigns and maybe some co-op. 

What is there is just okay I think. Nothing great, nothing (at least in my opinion) extremely bad either, especially considering it’s in early access. It could do with more work/polish, but that is what early access is for.

What kills it (for me at least) is the insane monetization for all the PvE stuff. You get a 3 tutorial campaign mission. want more missions? Pay up! And then have patience, because only half of the first campaign is out yet, with the remaining part still in development. 

You also get 1 free terran commander for the co-op part of the game.. Sorry, meant Vanguard instead of terran. Want another commander to play something else besides Vanguard? Pay up! To be fair here, the first few levels of each hero are free as well. Nice to try, but in the long run you’ll need to buy them, or hope for very acceptive teammates who will carry you through the missions. Carrying or being carried of course does not make for very fun games.. Also, be aware that co-op is also far from a complete mode, with most of it still being in development as well.

Now, paying for games is perfectly fine of course, but the price they are asking is just way too much for what you get. Or might get, considering at this point a lot is just a promise for the future. Add it all up, and you're looking at a new AAA release price tag. Except that this is nowhere near AAA quality (yet?), with both far less content, and too much incomplete content for the PvE player.

Apparently the pvp side of this is good from what people are saying. I did not try it myself, as I couldn't care less for that mode.

This is obviously still very much in early access. Things will be added and improved for sure. That still leaves us with way overpriced components. Which might be changed as well. Will this be worth it in the future? Maybe, time will tell. For now, I would stay clear of this if you are just interested in campaign and/or co-op!

Units are very responsive and pathing is quite reasonable for the development stage.

Artwork for the game itself is in a reasonable state, with room for improvement by 1.0 release.

I quite like the stylised artwork, and gives it a modern feel, like Fortnite or LoL.

I think that the new unit variety is great, and the neutral camps are an interesting addition to the SC2 format.

The main point that needs to be resolved is cinematic models, not the actual gameplay models which are lower resolution, and FG have said that this will be addressed soon. 

I would add one more point of easy improvement, turn on vSync by default to stop frame tearing upon first playing. I turned this on straight away and it looks much better.

The UX improvements to reduce the skill floor, especially building units and structures directly from anywhere on the map and automatically queuing them is a great feature and should help newer players macro more easily. 

Overall, a strong release to Early Access, appreciate the willingness to develop inline with community feedback and let us try it out for free before it is fully polished.

In stormgate co-op, you get ONE free hero, the human race, then the low low low low price of FIFTEEN DOLLARS of other heroes. meaning that

2. You cant ever experience other races unless you pay for a price equal to a small indie game for ONE hero/commander.

Do you want to know why the keybinds are an issue? They literally made half the game in Unreal and got to the end of the product and realised they couldn't integrate them into some proprietary engine they built for no actual reason.

They are still paying the licensing fee to use the Unreal engine. They saved likely no cost doing this. In fact, they spent even more money to build a custom engine for no real reason. Let that sink in. Think of how much money they wasted on this task alone instead of hiring a network engineer to retool UE5 for probably a fraction of the cost.

We haven't even gotten started on the other parts of the game or that you claimed ""all the content of year zero"" for the Kickstarter backers and went back on that. Also LOL at making your entire rts an esports focus. I guess you didn't learn your lesson at Blizzard.

-Poor performance on rtx3060/32ram/i7.   On a modest pc does even worse.
-pathfinding glitchy.  Units struggle to re-path around simple obstacles.
-Unplayable lag spikes during army confrontations.
-Odd glitches, locked in build selection mode, workers stuck in animations, map scroll locked, etc...
-Slow balance updates for game breaking inbalances.
-1 race rules them all.
-No 2v2
-No 3v3
-No 4v4
-Audio drops suddenly mid game and stays quiet the rest of game
-Lack of strategic depth, viable army compositions, diversity of tech paths, etc.  
-Because of above, games are already feeling samey.

----Old Review Below----

Mixed review incoming.  Thumbs up only because its free, so you might as well try it if it is up your ally.  If you don't like RTS, move along, this game does nothing more than you've probably already seen atm.  

Stormgate is the result of a one night stand between starcraft 2 and warcraft 3 where the result takes after warcraft much more than starcraft; units are beefy take a long time to die, and the pace of the game is slower. 

Unfortunately, neither parent really stuck around and and stormgate is still in its infant stage, so if I had to pay for it, I wouldn't.

The technical mechanics of the game are smooth and while more qol features are sure to come - the gameplay atm is responsive and units do what you tell them.  Although the pathfinding is a smidge worse than sc2, it is better than any other rts.  CoH, DoW, AoE, all have much worse Qol when it comes to selecting units and avoiding misclicks.  In this Stormgate does better than most.

however... Currently, there is no 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 or even the plan to make it happen, and while a 3v3 is in the pipelines, it is supposed to be different, more casual than 1v1.  This alone is enough of a reason for me to have not invited any friends to play.  Whats the point?  Playing coop against AI is kinda boring and quickly repetitive.

This game had a lot of expectations to live up to.  I play mostly pvp in rts, and have 1000s of hours in the genre with over 30k games played of sc2.  While I dislike the slower pace of this game I definitely think the experience of play is superior to all but starcraft2.  

The biggest downside is that the game doesn't do anything particularly different from sc2 or wc3.  You still have to micro, while macroing, hit your timings and understand the meta in order to play pvp.   So I don't really see the game as being easier to get into than starcraft2 with the exception that it is slower.  Make no mistake though, a slow player will still lose a slow game to a faster player - making the game slow doesn't lower the punishment for not paying attention, it just punishes both players by taking more time.

Units have no impact in stormgate and all dribble piss when they look like they should hit with a bang.  The iconic vulcan with a rotating machine gun might as well be shooting spitwads for all the damage it deals to units half its size.  And did I mention everything is super slow?

As far as coop or solo go...  Its free, so really, not sure what the complaint is unless it is from a backer.

Overall, nothing to lose if you try - but it will surely take time to learn as all rts do.",1723603895,2024-08-13 22:51:35

steam,172082706,"This isn't really a ""like"" more of a mediocre game review, I REALLY REALLY wish valve would allow a mixed review instead of yes/no. First off most of the hate for this came rightly comes from their first launch in early access where the models were awful, campaign was awful, multiplayer was awful etc.  Since then they realized oh shit we might actually go under if this keeps up and have revamped the campaign to make it decently fun at times.

        Honestly the campaigns alright got it for 20 on sale (barely a sale but whatever).  You slowly go through missions upgrade your units through credits such as in Wings of Liberty SC2, it also has research but in a dumber version with credits instead of the ""find zerg research or protoss research on maps"".  Overall it's a bit overpriced, has some clunky dialogue, while having  some decent game play.   The story is there I don't hate it I don't like it, the world building makes sense at times and other times it doesn't.

        The worst part about this game is by far the pricing, the free to play aspect is supposed to help by bringing more players for multiplayer, but throws everyone off with its terrible micro transactions.  Like right now all the co-op heroes are $8.50 individually, while being on sale (they are usually 10).  I don't see why you would spend money on half baked heroes currently when blizzard somehow offers co-op heroes cheaper in their co-op mode. Then you have pets for 5 dollars, campaign being around 20-25 depending on sale or not, along with the various packs they throw out which are super overpriced.  None of this surprises me since they are headquartered in California where everything's expensive to operate in.  

      Overall I give them a pity like for a mediocre game (that isn't really released it still feels like early access), I'd like to see Frost Giant learn from their mistakes and make the product serviceable.  Thank you for reading my over typed essay that basically says ""game mid"".",1723603582,2024-08-13 22:46:22
steam,172082257,"WC3/SC2 hybrid from Wish.

Without having high expectations, I gave it a fair shot and played it for a couple of hours - I tried a few skirmishes, and one mission/session each of campaign, coop, and pvp.

Note that the game is in early access so there are a number of bugs and missing elements. I won't mention these, but focus on the game design and direction.

Here is what I liked:
-Its free (so if you want to kill some time, you can try it).

Here is what I did not like:
-Combat feels slow and unsatisfying. Unit damage seems low and apparently there isn't a solid counter system.
-Too many abilities. I want to play an RTS, not the piano.
-Buildings and units are too similar, and I find it hard to differentiate them. In other games, I can clearly distinguish a factory from a command center, or a tank from a helicopter. I also can't tell what niche each unit is supposed to fill.
-Aesthetics and presentation are not appealing in general. I think they are too cartoony and unsuitable for the setting of the game. SC2 had a good balance of seriousness and cartoony graphics/humour. This game just feels off.

Some people have criticized the aggressive monetization of various elements (e.g. coop commanders), but this should not be a surprise for a F2P game. 

Overall though, its bland and doesn't draw me in like other strategy games.",1723602864,2024-08-13 22:34:24

Pros:
-Celestials are pretty unique gameplaywise i'll give them that.
-uhhh yeah I joke you not that's all I can think of as a pro for this game

Cons:
-90% of units are bland auto attackers with boring non impactful abilities
-The game looks like crap and uninspired, lots of things are just copy pasted from starcraft with zero effort, the vanguard are basically a 1 to 1 copy of terrans from sc2
-If you thought the mobile game level concept art was bad, just wait till you see the hero models or the campaign animated cutscenes. 
-The story is the most painful amalgamation of generic tropes and cliches, watching the story and the cutscenes invokes the same emotions as watching a ''you cringe you lose'' youtube compilation.
-The co-op mode they hyped up literally bugs out and stops working after 10~ minutes of ingame time because the game engine can't calculate a certain amount of units and projectiles existing at the same time on the map
-Audio is all over the place, either really loud or really quite, unit voice lines are as generic as they can be.
-Follows the starcraft formula but doesn't add or improve anything to it, quite the opposite this is a straight downgrade in all aspects. giving it exactly zero reason to be played over starcraft 2 which is better in every single category, co-op/campaign/competitive 1v1.
-The game is likely never coming out of early access as the developers said they are out of funding and they spend 1million+ per month, the early access was a last ditch effort to try and get more funding but with the comedic reception it received this game is basically going to be announced dead any moment now.

But i won't recommend it. It's a blizzard RTS. Former blizzard guys thought they know better and decided to do an RTS. Did they manage it. Yes and know

Well first of what is good in this game:

3 Races that play kind of differently, kind of not.
No other RTS has this Art style. You need to decide for yourself if it's a positive feature.
It's a mix of W3 and SC2.
They delivered on the things they promised from the kickstarter.
First 3 Missions are Free.
Game feels finished. No major crashes or bad bugs.
Oh, and the cinematics are great. Im serious, even in this ugly art style.

To the bad parts.

It's former blizzard, and strangely, it feels like the guys they had bad ideas. 
Mission 1 of the campaign is W3 First Mission, but it is worse. You could say its solid design. I say they copied it and made it worse than the original.
Pathing is also bad rn.
The races feel meh. I'm not a huge fan of W3 and maybe it's better if you are, but even then, the game feel is just not there jet . It's like Overwatch vs Diablo..... in an RTS....
Paystrucrure: Well, well, here I see the full blizzard influence. So basically you need to pay 60 Euro to get everything besides 1 Hero and a Pet i think. Let's skip the pet, because I'm not sure if it's in the 60 euro edition. But hey this sound like a AAA title price. Well plus the one hero how much can he cost? It's 10 euro. Actually every hero is 10 euro. So basically buying the bundle gives you a unit skin and a pet. 
Well, this sounds okay, right. AAA title prices are sometimes 70 bucks. 
And here is the problem: Its and Indie game in early acces that. Sure an indie game from former blizzard devs but its still an indie title.
And here is the problem: It's and Indie game in early access that. Sure, an indie game from former blizzard devs but It's still an indie title.
Also, hey, let's talk, coop. SC2 coop is great. So many different ways to play each faction. And even better, as soon as you get to the max lvl you unlock a broken ability that lets you overpower even the hardest mission. Meanwhile, here we have kinda the same, and the ability improvements are meh. I only read them, so maybe they are broken, but i didn't see any ""no suply limit"" or "" haha i can build carriers min  1""

So basically we have an mix between W3 and SC2 with bad pathing that asks you 70 euro for the full game. 
30 for the first part of a Campaign.
And 40 if you only want to play coop but still want to do all heroes.

So, hey, if you want to spend your money on former bliz devs to help fund this game, do it. 
But if you wanna have better gameplay and a cheaper experience, go play SC2. There are a ton of free campaigns or even brutal reworks of the old campaign. And it's way cheaper. You get 11 DIFFERENT heroes for 40 bucks, and this is without any discounts. You get more missions, and I would say that the first campaign that is free in Star Craft is way better than the first 3 missions you get here. 

That said, if the game gets better, I will change the review here. I still need to see if Coup gets any better. But seeing how things are going, this game would need a visit from Jesus to get somewhere above average for the 2012 RTS game.",1723593942,2024-08-13 20:05:42

steam,172075288,"As a player of Starcraft 2 for over a decade now, I was real excited at the prospect of finally getting a new RTS made by former Blizzard devs.

Boy, do I regret that now...

Even after getting almost 40 million dollars in funding before the game even released, it's infested with microtransactions, deluxe editions, and paying $10 for 3 campaign missions each chapter.
I'm not pulling any punches just because it's in ""eArLy AcCeSs"" either, the devs chose to release this to the public in it's current state.

This campaign is one of the most creatively bankrupt stories I've played in recent memory. No original ideas, just reuse the same Lich King story that Blizz has been wanking themselves off over for the past two decades.

Cutscenes are rendered like a powerpoint presentation. Choppy, low framerate that reminds me of stop motion action figures with mouth movements added in post production.
I thought I accidentally downloaded a sequel to Coraline while watching some of these scenes.
Speaking of mouth movement, the characters in game have none.
I guess they've all been practicing their ventriloquist acts recently.

The main character is a Rule 63 version of Jim Raynor mixed with Arthas, with all the ""current year"" toxic girlboss personality traits. An abrasive, unlikeable, constantly scowling b*tch that tries wayyyy too hard to be tough and cool.
Supporting characters include, but are not limited to:
- ""AI"" Assistant who entire purpose is to pilot the main character's transport ship
- Emasculated old black guy who's just there to get yelled at and dragged around by the main character 24/7
- Generic old man sniper who decides make the 200 IQ decision to call in an air drop over a canyon filled with anti-air defenses. And also makes the 300 IQ decision to go after the survivors all by himself and gets maimed.
- Random archaeologist woman who is relevant to the story for less than 10 minutes

The Infernals are made out to be this massive galactic threat in the lore, but they just end up feeling like weak, campy Saturday morning cartoon villains in reality.
""Oh no, not a million weak enemies that we can mow down easily with our superior firepower, but we're somehow supposed to be afraid of!""
How tf did the demons even wreck humanity this badly? They fight with SWORDS against guys in power armor! At least the Protoss had the brains to use energy blades.

The McGuffin, Thronos, is an ancient magic blade that corrupts the mind of it's wielder and absorbs the souls of it's slain enemies. Sound familiar?
After finding the first piece, the team decides to find the rest by ripping off the artifact drill mission in SC2: Wings of Liberty.
So is there a big galaxy-wide search for the four other missing blades that spans multiple missions/chapters?
Of course not! Amara just finds them all at once in some ancient temple and assembles the demonic fidget spinner of DOOOOMMM™!
(The main villain also randomly shows up without warning just to get his @$$ beat by Amara and her new toy; Another example of the villains being weak and posing no threat to the heroes whatsoever.)
Chapter 1 ends with her going rogue and finishing off the main villain in one of the most badly animated fight scenes in any game ever.

Thirty seven million dollars and this is the product they decide to give us?
Maybe the campaign will get better later on, but I'm judging it from what's been released so far.

I am having a ridiculous amount of fun. I am new to the genre, have tried other games like SC2 and AoE4, but this one has its hooks in me in ways others haven't. 

Importantly, for a player like me I feel like while I have loved the RTS learning process in other games, so much more of my attention in Stormgate is on strategy and fights than it is in other games rather than fast mechanical execution (but it's definitely still there to a satisfying degree!).

Campaign is fun, finally trying it now that it is labelled as complete. It's definitely not as polished in presentation than some other available options on the market, but it feels worth the price tag.

The caveat is: still as of release the product is a work in progress. Though, the progress they've made is incredible, and if the leap in the last year is any indication, I can't wait to see where they are in another year.",1723590932,2024-08-13 19:15:32

Unreal engine has a platform independent resolution upscaling solution which is not supported by this game, but it is in fortnite !?¿. Why not?
Even though, for the graphics shown on screen the fps are too low. Like endless dungeon.
No options to select each unreal engine graphic setting. Is lumen enabled or disabled? Global illumantion or screen space illumination? postprocessing level? blur level?  reflections? bloom? volumetric fogs? 

League of legends has better graphics and runs on a potato.

Also F1, F2, F3 keys are not mapped to the heroes.
Only one hero has inventory.
It is 2024, why the UI has to take 1/3 of the screen?
Is is 2024, 4vs4 is possible or will struggle?
Why always the same camera distance? Could it be further distance?
Terrain looks under-detailed
Character portraits are not animated: just put the 3D models on the same camera frustrum of the game and render on top.

Multiplayer is hero+micro focused (warcraft 3) or units+macro (starcraft 2), or both? I would like both xD

Firstly, the graphics are just plainly bad, everything mixes up on the screen, the army models look horrible and like a big clump of whateverness - unlike SC2, where you can easily see everything at a glance, this is just BAD! I don't know if it's the textures or the graphics style, but it's kid-style, not RTS-style.

Then the UI - what we've established in 25+ years in RTS's was just thrown into garbage and substituted with garbage. UI is horrible, unintuitive, unreadable, and the placement is overall wrong. Tool tips are randomly here and there, skills are in the wrong place, the build menu clumped with mineral overview might seem like a good idea, but WHY WOULD ANYONE LOOK THERE? I'm looking at the map or the minimap, rest is via hotkeys, so it's an extra place to go to for no reason.

Sounds - a mess overall, nothing distinguishing anything, generic.

Gameplay - again, a downgrade. They've learned nothing from any other game and implemented garbage that looks right in a mind of a mad hatter. Pathing is bad, skill use is bad, production is over-simplified, game map needs you to have intricate knowledge of some stuff and throws some stuff in your face - maybe decide which direction you wnat go??? Micro is impossible with all the whateverness and clumpiness.

Same goes with the Co-Op Commanders. You can one for free, the rest costs 9,99- EACH! So to play everything, you have to pay at least 70 bucks.

No thank you...",1723589533,2024-08-13 18:52:13
steam,172073182,"[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
In one word: derivative. If you're interested in a good RTS with the same vibe, play Starcraft 2 (Wings of Liberty is F2P with the co-op mode AND the extensive custom games arcade included which Stormgate doesn't seem to have an interest in at the time) or find a copy of the original Warcraft 3 that fell off the back of a truck which offers many of the same benefits. This ain't it, chief.

My playtime is not that high but I tried what the early access had to offer and I have enough experience with RTS games that I think I can make a pretty good judgement call about what I saw:

[h1]The campaign[/h1]
The UI of the menus and presentation was the first thing that hit me. ""It's very Starcraft"" I told myself with everything laid out and presented in a very similar way. The first impression of the campaign was not an especially good one with the stylized Fortnite-esque art style not quite hitting with the more serious story vibe they were going for on top of just not being very appealing in cutscenes. Mediocre and cliche plot beats, uninspired voice acting and even the music which was a memorable part of its predecessors is not especially notable. After a briefing that once again copies Starcraft's presentation, I'm hit by utterly atrocious performance as the mission begins and the game lags like crazy. My computer isn't the strongest but it's enough to handle even some of the more intense Starcraft 2 custom maps with a lot of units and only mild performance drops but here I've had issues even on low settings with a relatively small number of units present which can't be justified by its visual fidelity.

After restarting everything on low settings, the first few missions felt like a homage to Warcraft 3's hero-focused design. Your main character has a 6 slot inventory and a blink ability you can use to get a few cheeky items hidden around while learning the basics of moving, shooting and so on while the next two missions give you access to the roster of the not-Terran units and buildings. All of these are made trivial by how overpowered your hero unit is and don't make a particularly good attempt to teach you how to play the race's strengths.

This very short lived experience is immediately after blocked by a paywall for the next three missions so that's all there is to it. Oh, and there's no pausing. Or saving for that matter.

[h1]The co-op[/h1]
Next I moved on to the co-op. Virtually all of it is a 1:1 copy of Starcraft 2, except you only get one free commander and the other five cost $10 each to unlock, twice as much as Starcraft 2 charged. All the missions I played bar one were clones of SC2's without the campaign context to back them up. The whole experience felt like a cheap knockoff copy and the choice to raise the player cap to 3v1 is a dubious one and I'd argue only one of the missions played to its strengths. Poor performance showed its head again, particularly as armies got bigger and certain effects like the not-Protoss pylon field were visible. Moreover, a number of other strange design choices (like making one of the co-op colours dark purple which made it almost impossible to see health bars properly or having a mission with an allied faction that was the same colour as one of the players) made me question the testing that went into it. In the end, it just made me want to go back and play Starcraft 2's co-op instead.

[h1]Skirmish and the three races[/h1]
I am not a competitive player so I only did a few games against AI to try out the other races in more detail. This game mode also suffers from interface issues, a lack of lobby chat, a limit to 1v1 and 2v2 games only and other QoL I'd expect. When it comes to the three races, the cartoony artstyle isn't an issue but there's a general lack of attention to detail or polish in most of the details which is evident in fights. The units themselves feel a lot more homogenous and less impactful than the ones in Starcraft ever were and I found myself feeling like I was making a blob of unit soup regardless of whether I went for bio, mech or some other combination of units. 

Without going into detail, the species themselves fall into the broad strokes of not-Terran, not-Zerg and not-Protoss and, while they have some innovation, I found it very hard to point at any unit and not just say ""This is X from Starcraft/Warcraft"" with some variation. Fights felt vague and unclear on why someone was winning or losing beyond having the bigger blob of units because the game seem to lack strength in the rock-paper-scissors unit design and the audiovisual cues needed to quickly relay the state of a fight. On top of that I ran into pathfinding issues with units getting stuck in blobs, leading to many cases where they were either locked in place blocking the path or dragging other units, including enemies, along when moving past them. The only other aspect that stood out was a Warcraft 3 creep camp mechanic which felt lacking to the progression of a game the former displayed. Perhaps at a very high level of play this is different but I can't speak for that.

[h1]Early access and live services[/h1]
There are some games for which early access is an opportunity to improve and bugfix a reasonably complete experience, while adding and polishing existing content. This is not one of those games. It feels like the very raw core of an experience that [i]could[/i] hypothetically be good eventually, but in its current state is a very underbaked offering that spreads itself too thin in trying to please everyone while not having any identity of its own. 

Given its F2P nature and AA studio, I am more lenient with its shortcomings and I'm sure some of the issues I complained about will eventually be fixed but the fact of the matter is that this game exists alongside Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 which are playable and far more complete experiences right now and that makes it a lot harder to recommend when it's not just overshadowed but it willingly lies in the shadow of the former two titles. In this environment, a copycat would need to be exceedingly competent, or otherwise innovate to stand out and Stormgate does neither. 

It's saying a lot when the first things you see in the game are a paywalled campaign, a paywalled co-op experience, and even a reserved spot for paid cosmetics ON TOP of having an extremely successful Kickstarter and having several paid versions/packs for sale to the point where finding the actual F2P button on Steam was a surprisingly convoluted task. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035144686/recommended/2012510/]This other review[/url]  goes into more detail on some of the funding shortcomings. 

I cannot in good faith believe this will be a sustainable approach to player retention and monetization when the stigma of such a rudimentary early launch will bleed its player count for a significant part of its upcoming future while at the same time the devs seem more concerned to focus on the esports scene.",1723589426,2024-08-13 18:50:26
steam,172073053,"What the hell is this?

35 million bucks from investors + 2 million bucks from Kickstarter.
4 years of development.
Team and two guys pissing in your ears that they worked on SC2, WC3 and Diablo etc.

What they made?
Game with no option of pause the game when you playing campaign, WHAT?
Absolutely ugly animation of units, some of them seems like sliding, I swear if you hire couple people from freelance, they will make it better.
Units don't have portrait animation. Main menu like from mobile game.

Have you seen Main character Amara? I'm super seriously have you seen her face and hands? Please tell who made her? who in company approved this!? My friend down to 6 o'clock. 
For example have you seen Kerrigan before she became monster or Jaina from WarCraft 3 which was made in 2002? How they are gorgeous.

Dev's paid to some pro players and media people to talk sheet to people, how game is good and will be better.
On January I played beta and now on release played one co-op mission, seems like I ate something not eatable and wishing to play Star Craft 2 or WarCraft 3 for completely clean and forget what I have played before.

Tim Campbell said on Kickstarter trailer ""This is the beginning of next ten years for RTS genre"". 
Hope this game lasts at least a year. But who cares? money went somewhere but not on game development.

steam,172072585,"Rough gamestate right now.

The developer is made from veteran Warcraft 3 and Starcraft 2 devs. And that shows. Both good and bad.
The game is fluid enough to be playable right now, but all the stuff you hate from Warcraft 3 are here as well. Like units blocking each other in the most stupid ways imaginable (like, why do range units go to the front and melees stay back and then can't get past when it matters?). Also terrible storytelling and cringe jokes.

UI also still needs plenty work.

The art style is debateable at best, depressingly childish at worst.

The races are... well, they are very damn close to SC2, while not being as interesting.
The big focus on casted abilities will shy away casual gamers as controlling those will need quite a bit of training.

Honestly the ""mixed"" overall score is prob. fair. Id say 30-40/100 is the current state of the game and if they add / update all they promise to do, it will be around 60-65/100 probably.

Campaign missions are not free, but cost 10 bucks per 3 missions which can be done in very few minutes.

One thing people are not talking about is the lack of lag, at least for my end i have not noticed any lag even vs many names in languages i dont understand. 
Coop is pretty ok, needs more work but it has potental. 
story is rough but i did not enjoy Star craft 2s story either so im not the target aduiance for it but I hope they put more effort into this side becasue the casuals are the bulk of a games playerbase and that is key for keeping it healthy.

Old Review is below.
GG Fantastic. My favorite part is how you can onboard yourself without any tutorial or bs. The buddy bot is the best feature. If your new to RTS's check this out. The buddy bot will do a lot of the confusing rts stuff for you. Until you start to figure it's shortcomings and want to get more creative with your strategy. Then you'll slowly wean yourself off it. And suddenly your an rts gamer. 10/10 perfect onboarding. I wouldn't want it anyother way. 
A few things for the devs. Make the buddy bot a button on the menu with the custimization check boxes that pop up after you click it. Right now it's buried in the options. It took me just a little bit to figure out why things were just building themself. If I didn't find that, then that could have been frustrating and leave a bad taste for first impression.  

Also for anyone who thinks the designs aren't original or whatever. I think they are instead very well done nods to other games and media. Like the vanguard has some halo, and gundam reference. It's great! Love it.

Seriously, how do they have characters not moving their mouths in the campaign but they had time to implement a cash shop with pets in an RTS game is beyond me ... I wanted to like the game, but it just feels outdated in every sense.

Also, you don't have the ability to SAVE MISSION PROGRESS in the single-player campaign ... let that sink in",1723583993,2024-08-13 17:19:53
steam,172068797,"heavily disappointing game. Pretty much just checks the box for blizzard nostalgia, but the graphics leave much to be desired. Especially in the cinematics/cut scenes. its like watching Team America if it was made by BioWare using the same design philosophy as SWTOR. Also, not a fan of the post apocalyptic aesthetic, but thats a personal point.

steam,172068277,"TLDR: The game is fun for early access and shows a lot of potential. I will play it regularly to keep up with the game and seeing all of the changes, but I will also continue to play the polished game of SC2. 

I am looking at all of these reviews, and seeing a fair amount of negative reviews. Majority of these negative reviews read as though the people were expecting a full game on the release of the early access, and forgetting the stage of the development of the game which is indeed early access. The 1.0 version of the game is not out yet, and probably will not be until a year from now. 

Out of the 12 or so hours I have played of this game, I have thoroughly enjoyed just playing the game. I still play SC2 with my brother, but this game is a nice refreshment of the genre of RTS while feeling very similar to the game that I hold dear to my heart.

steam,172068089,"THE MOMENTS I REALIZED STORMGATE WASN'T FOR ME

1. it didn't start great, my first (so far only) skirmish against A.I. I was Terran, comp was the crystal Protoss-y guys. immediately off the jump, I wasn't at all into the basic, plastic-funtastic vibe of any the buildings. or, somehow more worryingly, my wacky robo-builder units' ""Hi-ho, Hi-ho"" jokester command lines. but fine, whatever, I can deal for now. maybe they're still ironing out the vibe of the game. though I definitely don't remember this degree of cartoon tone in the underwhelming NextFest demo awhile back. I think I may be in trouble on this one. anyway. it's about the GAMEPLAY. 

2. The GAMEPLAY seems to be *far* sub-Starcraftian in ... anything. everything. and it begins so simply (literally): you've got your minerals for cash and your secondary resource (think Vespian gas, only floaty rocks) for flavor and placement / buid-order disparity. and I sent my hi-hoh-bots on over to the floaty rock resource right next to my starting base, and ... they started quickly collecting and bringing it on back to the command center. no extra step, no special building needed (at least for the Terrans). secondary resource is just more minerals only they're not called minerals, they're called something else. uh-oh. now I KNOW I'm in trouble on this one. this is now feeling distinctly Mobile Phone RTS. not at all what I'm personally looking for. 

(Age of Empires 3, my hot-take favorite RTS, has three different resources you've got to keep track of, plus managing how to collect EXP for civ-dependent home city shipments ... Age 2 has four resources. Starcraft just has the two, but of course you've got to do special THINGS to get at the gas, which needs to be planned for and collected with different rules than minerals.)

3. I hate to say it, but this was the one that let me know this wasn't gonna be my game -- that it wasn't made with me in mind (which is fine, obviously -- but disappointing for me personally): I started to build those jet-cockpit mech walkers that seem to be this game's marketing icon, and was ordering them around, and ... well, one of the voice lines came back something like ""They may not be scared of me ... but they haven't met CINEMON."" then you hear a stock cat mew sound effect. is it shallow of me that this was the most immediately disappointing example? it is. certainly seems that way. 

it just says to me that this game's made for an audience that's ... I don't know. meme-hungry, I guess, which of course (who isn't?) but it's the fact that this is a drawn-out unit response line out of maybe three for the coolest unit in the game ... and this unit's gonna be saying it a lot. a LOT a lot. units repeat themselves almost every click. and call me cringe if you want, but that's the sort of priority for RTS design that shows a lot. not for me. how's that.

4. Finally, and of course most ultimately worrisome is the computer opponent built I think six or seven units that were all sitting politely in its base, waiting for my army of dozens to destroy them. I've got a capture of the endgame tally. I guess I had the AI set to ""off"" or something. room for improvement, for sure. 

I hope this game works for people. I hope it IS the ""Future of Real Time Strategy"" that PC Gamer declared it was part of on a cover story a year back or so. we NEED more games like this, and yet so, *so* far fewer games that FEEL like this -- Fortnite Dayglo Jokester Warfare. cartoon NPC chickens merrily running around the battlefield. cat joke[s] from units marching off to battle. yurgh. I guess can only say ""not for me"" so many times before I start to wear my keys out.    

I guess the reason I go on and on (and on and on) is that I so WISH this game WAS for me. may Stormgate find its confidence to be something new and may it find an identity that doesn't feel thrift store 2010 Gaming. I believe it CAN. I hope it will. be well.

I RECOMMEND you try it, but just do NOT approve at all of its style. or it's mechanics. or really anything yet. not so far, anyway. it's early days.",1723582934,2024-08-13 17:02:14

steam,172067427,"This game is absolutely a work in progress, but that's a good thing. It shouldn't be done yet, in fact, in reality, I'm kind of happy it's going to be in Early Access for a bit longer. Besides the extremely obvious reasoning that they already likely have assets and are recording voice lines to replace filler lines, Stormgate and those who developed it put work into their project and it shows. The variety of abilities, units, and ways to interact with with each other in game, is pretty awesome. I do wish that a different race had been chosen for launch missions, but that's just my subjective opinion, no real major issue with that.

While I would definitely say the game needs more time, that's perfectly fine, cuz like everyone else, it's not perfect, it's a labor of love, that takes time and dedication to make into something amazing. I definitely think it's well on it's way though, considering the dev team's credentials, and passions put into the game. It's a game designed by people who made and played the last generation of rts games, and now, they're all working together to make something interesting and unique, that keeps that same feeling from the original games they were modeled from. This is in addition, to as far as we know, pretty healthy working conditions for the employees, so I wouldn't want them to overexert themselves in that way either. 

For the people who want an RTS that will give you nostalgia, but be a definitively different experience, try Stormgate. And If you've looked at stormgate, gave it a try, and you don't like it, well that's ok. The game wasn't made for you then, which is totally fine. The game was made, for a specific demographic of people who played a certain selection of games, if you aren't one of those people, you weren't expected to like it in the first place. Plus, Let's be real, there's not a ton of RTS games out there, and this one is hardly a bad option among the others.

I did know what to expect, though.

As a fan of Warcraft 3 and Starcraft 2, I definitely think this game is fun and is growing in a good direction. There are obvious problems that I know Frost Giant are working on, and even so I think the game is polished more than I expected.

Many people have left negative reviews, and I think they might be warranted and entitled to their opinion as purchasers, but as a free to play enjoyer I have not had such a negative experience on neither the direction of the game, nor the actual experience.

This game takes lags to a new, previously unreachable level. 
It stutters, it freezes, it skips animations for 10 seconds to play them at once after. 
If this isn't enough, this game lacks animation synchronization at all, every unit slides, teleports, and moonwalks so hard, MJ would be impressed.
It creates an atmosphere of fewer nightmares or sick post-modernism performance. I wasn't sure if the game was so bad or I had a stroke.  Sound design and VA added their note to the cacophony of madness.

Co-Op is cool, though a bit simple (same since beta?). Only 1 free hero, can't even try the rest. Shame..

Fighting in general is a bit boring (doesn't ""grab"" me like C&C, WC3, SC). 

Was annoyed by the sounds, the balance is way off, maybe that's why I was missing the ""oomph""?

Monetization scheme is also 'next-gen' ;-)? Aka anti-customer friendly imho. 10€ / co-op hero, 10€ / 3 story missions.
* First off, why does it need to be exactly 10€? Why can't it be 7,95€? Or even 50% discount, aka 3,99€, during the early access for that community that you so desperately need?
* Second, I don't see the value personally, I think it's overpriced for what you get.

10 Bucks for 3 campaign missions? The free one's didn't sell me on a grand and inspiring campaign. I've never even been diamond at SCII comp, and I rolled over ""hard"" missions without even dusting off my RTS-rust.
'Intro missions' be damned. You want me to blind buy and trust that your campaign missions are worth 10$? I don't even wanna' replay your FTP missions. What's gonna change in the next set of missions?

Side note:
The unit pathing is still glitchy, and it's never nice to see units order to attack on sight, running back and forth unable to find a route to attack.

I wanna' try coop missions with friends, but it's another 10$ PER commander?! Even if I did like the game mode with friends, WHERE IS THE VALUE? I usually spend 10-100 hours on a free to play game before I start sinking my cash in. But, I can't even find a reason to put 5 hours into this game.
And let's talk about the monetary spending. 50$ on release, and major content probably scheduled to be coming every quarter? This game wants 200$ a year f.. For what exactly..? When you're game's not up to snuff.. You hook people in by being 'free'. 
I've never seen more disgusting 'bait' in my life. Honestly, Diablo Immortal looked more appetizing with it's deals than this.

I changed my review and I now recommend this game. 
It still lacks content of course, we need much more different missions in coop.

The sound is a problem, SFX are not good quality and everything feels dull and muzzled. 

For AZERTY players, converting the QWERTY setup is a bit of a headache, especially if you want A+click for attack. I'm not satisfied with the automatic group control setup, having army in 1 instead of base is weird. 

Some gameplay issues : You can't really select a mineral field. You rally your workers to a field, but there is no visual confirmation, it's a bit clunky. 

The map and army lacks a lof of visibility. In fight, I struggle to find my units between allies. White is not the best color to visualize my army in map ! Why not green ? 

The victory screen after a coop game appears instantly, it needs some more details on game stats, and an animation before it.

1v1 is very fun and responsive on a moderately powerful PC. It feels like a blizzard RTS but the dev team is still active and passionate. It's extremely half-baked and FG has a very extensive list of things to tackle in the next year.
----------------------------------------

I kick-started the game on the first day and have played a lot since then. I'm strictly going to review the competitive 1v1 ladder as that's the only mode I play. I have not dabbled in co-op or played the campaign but I can absolutely see where the criticism for those modes is coming from. 

Frost Giant set out to create the spiritual successor to Blizzard RTS. If you have played any blizzard RTS games in the past SG will feel immediately familiar and intuitive. The games foundation and building blocks are very impressive. The work they have done modifying unreal engine and creating snowplay has created a game that feels fluid responsive. Unreal/snowplay is not perfect though. The game definitely needs polish and optimization passes to help lower end PCs and late game battles.

The 3 factions are pretty unique and fun to play. There is always going to be balance considerations and strategies that are going to frustrate people. The key here is FG is actively listening to feedback and improving the balance.

I was very skeptical of neutral creep camps when they were announced. I actually quite like the current implementation of them. They force you out of your base to be active and create some interesting dynamics on the map. I do think the rewards they give currently are slightly overturned tho. 

The maps are all very unique and play differently. Different maps allow for different strategies and tactics which I like. They are not all similar templates with different tile sets. 

The top bar abilities add a different global flavor to each race. 

Celestials play very different than your typical Blizzard RTS race. I haven't spent mech time with them but the flying workers and main building add some unique dynamics to matches.

They have attempted to simplify macro with grid and quick build hot keys. A lot of RTS veterans won't utilize these features but I actually find myself using and enjoying them more and more. Despite FGs attempts to lower the skill floor SG is still very much a game of playing fast, accurately and making a lot of decisions very quickly. 

Units have a lot of health and generally die slower. There are some exceptions but overall there is more room to micro units during fights. I have noticed that because units die slower. If you get a little behind in a fight and lose some dps from your army fights can slowball really hard against you if you're not careful.

I will say despite the games impressive foundation and building blocks it is very much in a state of extremely early access. I understand they need to make money and ambitious projects take a lot of time to create. FG has an absolutely massive list of features and bugs that need to be addressed going forward.

It's disappointing that we reached public early access with such limited customizable hotkeys. I understand this is challenging to implement in unreal but it is also a core feature expected in an RTS.

The game is a lot of fun, I love it and will continue to play it as it evolves closer to FGs final vision. At the same time the game is extremely half baked. I can't help but think the public early access would be a good starting point for a year long closed beta.

You only really get one chance to show new customers what your game is about. I think a far more polished vertical slice might have done better. Right now you are asking players to look past a very, very long list of ""we here you but we are a small team and need more time to implement"".",1723578140,2024-08-13 15:42:20
steam,172063676,"**As of this update to my review on 26 september, I cannot find games at all for PvP and I cannot select the custom games from a playlist so fuck this game until the company gets their shit together. I desperately wanted this game to succeed but having a player count of 300 for your brand new, revolutionary RTS is not a good sign**


I can sum it all up in a single word - ""Placeholder""

Would be interesting to see how it turns up in a few months time or maybe even a year, but right now, stacraft 2 runs better on the highest setting than this game on the lowest on my system.

Edit after playing for a few hours - 

1. Weird jitters in a lot of PvP games
2. Not really a fun experience to learn things in this game, especially in a PvP setting. I understand the whole point is being competitive but tight build orders seem too powerful, which would be fun to execute if the controls and the general feel of the game was tight, but that's not the case. 
3. Holy shit the nickle and dime microtransaction is so bad. If it had more co-op commanders and maps/missions, I would spend more time with it, because it has been forever since I played a new RTS, but it's all behind a ridiculous paywall. 
4. Campaign missions are extremely unimaginative and boring. Remember how SC2 had missions where every single mission introduced a new mechanic and a new setting and new challenges ? forget that, all missions boil down to make base and clear out enemies.
5. There is a reason campaigns generally have significantly different and more expansive mechanics compared to the online PvP, it's not the case here, the campaign missions, atleast the free ones are offensively barren. Everything from the writing, to the design, to the content just feels like it is a placeholder for something the team will actually work.

I do intend to spend more time in it, but as it stands, this is barely a foundation, Frost Giant has to build one before they make the actual game, because this is not it. I hope they do though, would be interesting to have a new SC2 level of RTS that they promised us that would go for years on end.",1723578091,2024-08-13 15:41:31
steam,172063615,"TLDR; Focusing on getting campaign out second after 1v1 was a mistake. The priority should have been on beefing up the engine and getting the map editor into our hands so the community could get behind this game. At this point I am more convinced than ever that this game will flop. But personally I do still hold hope that it will one day make it as I do still believe the people behind it are passionate and committed to getting what they promised into our hands. They just need the money that they are currently (2025) a long way off from having.

[b]The 1v1[/b]
The 1v1 is not my forte so I'm not going to get into it. It seems to have a fanbase so if this is your priority, then the rest of my review might be meaningless to you.

[u]Campaign[/u]
3 / 10
This experience falls so short of it's competitors it's, in my opinion, pitiful for the cost. The voice acting [i](literal pain)[/i], the depth of each mission [i](where's the secrets?! where's the exploration?! why does it all feel so jank?!)[/i], the difficulty consistency, it is all [b]BAD![/b] The voice acting got to the point of pissing me off so much I stopped talking to NPCs just to avoid the terrible voice overs! One thing the game gets right in the last six missions is a pretty good feel to the actual gameplay. If they kept going making improvements to the next batch at their current rate of improvement then in a year it will be on par with the likes of the best. But as it is currently, the new player experience is barely something I would recommend to someone. Then the second batch of missions [b]that's the first you pay for[/b] are clearly the worst of them all and desperately need a complete makeover. The final 6 missions feel good in the actual game but the story aspect is [b]complete and utter CRAP![/b] This is mostly due to the terrible voice acting. It ruins everything around it.
   All that being said... I'm still buying the next batch of content. At the rate of improvement I've seen I believe all they need is to beef up their engine tech/capabilities so their in house team and possibly the community with a map editor could really start to flex and build awesome content!

[u]Co-op vs AI[/u]
5 / 10
I liked the co-op vs AI experience, but it got tiring very quickly. Each mission feels like a less-good SC2 copy. The difference between each of the heroes you can buy follows an exact formula; 1 unique hero you control, 2 unique top bar abilities, 2 re-styled and reskinned units from their races' normal units, and 2 added unique upgrades. It's nothing compared to how unique each of SC2s' commanders felt. No reskin for every unit, every hero has every unit their race normally gets, buildings don't change at all... I'll admit, there's also gear unlocks, but beyond giving a reason to level to max it's just not enough for me to justify the cost. Not worth it.
   But.... They said they are pushing out a 3v3 player vs player experience soon that uses the heroes. This is something SC2 never did and it's brilliant in my opinion. The way they have described it sounds like a really cool experience! [i]crosses fingers and whispers[/i] please be good, please be good, please be good......

[b]Summary[/b]
I believe that the studio Frost Giant really does want to accomplish the best they can. They just lack the money to do so comfortably. Maybe this will just take time and a small studio of passionate people?

We are where we are now and the final chapter of Frost Giant Studios could be right around the corner... But if they can get the money. Then eventually I personally believe that this game really will become a great one. But it needs to pull off the same thing Hello Games pulled off.


Dear Frost GIant:

Good luck! I'm personally still going to support you. But there is no way I am going to recommend this game to my friends yet.

Very much looking forward to the map editor coming out for custom maps, and looking forward to being able to queue for team games.

7/3/2025 - I am changing my review to negative. I was wrong. It did not get better. Watching them struggle to find their footing, changing creep camps, adding stormgates.. It all means nothing when multiplayer is an imbalanced nightmare that straight up is not fun to play. Been playing a year now, even longer if you count Next Fests. I feel like every patch is just.. a lateral move that does not make the game better.

 Everything is off. The pacing, the meta, the balance, the units, the economy.. Stormgates showing up at the same exact time extremely limits early game build variety, in this game with already extremely limited builds. There are still no multiplayer team queues and there is barely anyone ever on to play with, leaving you to end up facing the same guy in 1v1 over and over.

There are so many new RTS games coming out, and Stormgate absolutely does not stand up to any of it's competitors.

steam,172060911,"Before playing I thought the reviews were a bit harsh but sadly I have to agree after playing a versus match with each faction, versus supposedly being the most complete part of the game.

I'm completely underwhelmed. The whole game feels off and sluggish. Big battles are boring. Units are so tanky you can basically break away from any fight and not take any damage anymore.

The factions strengths and the way they're supposed to be played doesn't make much sense. I will use celestials (protoss race) as an example because they are the worst designed imo.

- There is a power field but it doesn't actually do much? You can still build stuff outside of it and hide one of the small army production building right next to your enemy base and have all your army unit come out of it.
- There's a total of three things that can build buildings and I really don't see the need for so many units having the same role? Your main command center can build, and it has two different types of workers, one that can mine and build and the other can only build. Why? Oh and one of the worker type is literally a moving protoss pylon.

steam,172060417,"TLDR: Needs a lot of work but shows potential

Look, this game has a lot of issues. Like this is supposed to be the Starcraft replacement but, everything and I mean everything is a long ways to go from Starcraft. I want this game to succeed but I honestly think it needs like 3-5 more years of work before I can even consider this to be on par with SC2. Lets go into the specifics.

Graphics: They're mid or bad. Like it is trying to be this hybrid realistic and cartoonishy hybrid but it really isn't good enough. I can't really add anything else because this is such a common complaint that the dev team established.

Voicelines, Dialogue, and SFX: Yes, they're either bad or mid. I really have a bone to pick with the voicelines and dialogue in this game because it is just bad or cringe. I don't feel like a Crusader when he speaks. I feel like a 12 year old boy with a sword. To put it simply, I don't believe the characters take themselves seriously. This sucks because what makes a game like SC2 are the SFX and voicelines combining to make this cinematic masterpiece. 

Gameplay: Mid. Co-op is alright, Story is absolutely bad and short, and PVP feels awkward. First off, a lot of the key shortcuts are gone. You have to manually set it up yourself. Please just steal all the keybinds from SC2. I honestly can't comment on the gameplay too much because it is so undercooked.

RTS games DO NOT get this kind of attention EVER, this was a golden ticket. Not to mention the 40 million they raised for this game, that is the highest budget an RTS game has had since LOTV.

This game is way too expensive for what it offers. I am a huge RTS fan and have been waiting a while for this, but offering it at the same price as StarCraft (A complete AAA game) released at, while also in EA, is ridiculous. 
The game's units are just copies of previous games. The pathing is clunky and the game world feels uninspired. They really took a back seat when it came to Art.
The only new feature for this RTS seems to be microtransactions.
The story feels like it was written in a day just to say they have one. They should have just kept that in the oven and released F2P VS maps. Yet instead, they give away a free chapter that only leaves you disappointed and unwilling to buy.
I have been following this product and am amazed at how little progress they have made. If this is the best they can do, I understand why we do not have a StarCraft 3.
They need to go back to the drawing board as this is not better or different than the solid RTS games that we already have. Don’t waste your money on this greed campaign.
The only positive thing I have to say about it is that it is an RTS.

steam,172055349,"I judge this game on the merits of what Early Access means to me, and what I see as the vision for this game beyond what is there.

First, it is clear the devs have taken an approach to build a strong base, and focus on building out from there. The core of the netcode and gameplay experience is very tight, and their Snowplay tech shows that unreal 5 can be a monster RTS platform. 

That said, that foundation is more or less all that is there in the game right now. I've played hundreds of 1v1 games from the beta through the last 2 week preview period, and if you're interested in that, you'll be very happy. It feels 70%+ done to me and i really can't wait to see what custom maps look like for it.

If you're here for campaign however, the content I would describe as being closer to 10~20% done due to many placeholder assets still filling the early missions and cinematics. It's clear they plan to improve these while making new missions, but there's fair criticism that for Solo players, there isn't much here(yet!).

If you played SC2 co-op, you will be right at home. The main folks behind this game more or less built SC2's co-op systems and updates over the years. Even my wife is playing this co-op with me! The missions will feel very similar to you, personally I enjoy the loop but I hope to see what kind of cool stuff their tech allows them to do with missions down the line.

The game is still very early, not even halfway complete imo. That said, I have played over 150 hours and will continue to play until StarCraft 3 comes out or the sun swallows the earth. If you like 1v1/Co-op, this early version of Stormgate will satisfy. If you're looking for a more polished solo/cinematic experience, let them cook.",1723569419,2024-08-13 13:16:59

steam,172051440,"I'm thoroughly enjoying this game, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys RTS. The amount of progress the game has made over the course of the last year is amazing! When I played at the EA release, I had some fun, but not enough to keep me coming back. Now I legitimately want to play more. The visuals are way better. The audio is way better. The stormgate mechanic in PvP is way better than creeps, making games feel more dynamic. Units look better. Units feel better. Pathing is better. Account progression feels good. Custom maps exist and are awesome. I haven't played the campaign yet, but I'm excited to. The amount of fun that you can get from the game without spending any money is honestly fantastic. There are just so many reasons to recommend the game.

Has the studio made some mistakes? Yes. I didn't back the game on kickstarter, but I'm sympathetic towards those who did and haven't received what they thought they were going to receive. It's also regrettable that if it weren't for the kickstarter fiasco, the steam reviews would likely be in the 80-90% approval range, which is great for any game with competitive PvP.

Stormgate captures the responsive asymmetrical RTS feel I have grown to love. There are changes and balancing to be done but the unit interactions and strategies at play so far have been intuitive and feel good. Bugs are being addressed quickly and the different modes are coming along well. I have been thoughally enjoying the game and even as a lower skilled player matchmaking has me at around a 50% win rate over time. I would have liked the cinematics to show more of the units in battle scenes as I believe the world building and feel for the lore is whats missing here. Give my imagination something to grasp onto. I will reference the SC2 zerg attack on a terran world and how all the units were displayed in that cinematic. I feel that would really help to sell the world.

I personally genuinely enjoy the game, I love the multiplayer so far, the game still needs work with the Tier 3 units and unit pathing and collision, replays need work, the GUI and menus in general need work. The campaign is a good start too and looks promising but needs work as well.

Ok now that we got past that, the game's character design overall is really good and interesting, some people do not like what they consider a cartoony design which is definitely valid however I for one like the design, this game is the closest anything has come to Starcraft 2 for me and has genuine potential 10 years down the line, remember Starcraft 2 now is nothing like what it was on release, so give stormgate your time and attention and let it grow.",1723546610,2024-08-13 06:56:50

What's next, timed exclusives and monthly subscription to use a map editor? Bad signs from a dev that doesn't want to be Blizzard.

Also, not a criticism per se but they triple dipped on crowd funding campaigns (kickstarter, indiegogo late backing, startengine) and also scored several tens of millions worth of investments from companies like Riot.

Blizzard 2?

If you want a fun RTS that doesn't have ""f2p cash hell"" foreshadowing then go check out Tempest Rising or D.O.R.F. Real-Time Strategic Conflict. Or Zero-K, which is free.

I can't recommend it for purchase just yet but I CAN say that it has a lot of potential.

recommended touch ups:
Voice lines
Character models
Price adjustments for Coop Commanders (no one should pay 15 a piece per commander)
Attack animation cancels for Amara in campaign
Nerf Amara in campaign, you can walk thru any enemy force with her

Pros:
Stunning environments for cinematics, Seriously, that water is beautiful
New global build/training hotkeys that will take some time for vets to get used to
3 Very diverse factions to play as that almost seem like a meld of many classic rts games

Cons:
Currently only 6 missions of the Human faction featuring ARTHAS erm... I mean Amara (more to come)
SOOO many familiar voice lines
expensive Coop commanders (worth noting twice)
Versus AIs could get beat by a toddler

The developer is very keen on feedback so you can have a chat with them sometimes on discord, which is cool.
Still, it's very early in early access, if you don't like that, I don't recommend it. But as you can see from my playtime, I had a tonne of fun with it already. With Campaign, COOP and the editor/customs as my main focus in RTS games, Stormgate ticks all the boxes, it's like a Starcraft 2 with a developer that actually cares about their game.

What really excites me is that this game comes from the talented team behind StarCraft II. While Stormgate shares some similarities with that legendary RTS, it also manages to carve out its own identity. The art style is visually stunning, bringing a fresh and vibrant look to the genre, and the three factions are well-designed, offering distinct and engaging gameplay experiences that add depth and variety to every match.

I truly believe that Stormgate has all the ingredients to become the next big RTS esports title. The foundation that has been laid is solid, and I’m eager to see the additional content and improvements that the developers have in store. Whether you're a long-time RTS fan or new to the genre, Stormgate has something to offer, and I’m confident it’s a game that will only get better with time.

The game is definitely not finished and the current price tag is not worth it. Too many bugs everywhere to even list, and it's bugs that actually get in the way of the normal experience, you don't have to be doing some niche thing to find them. Some issues aren't actual bugs, instead they're just the quality of some features (such as pathfinding, UI, menus) being so far beneath what you're used to in other RTS titles. 

The visual identity of the game is so bland and average that I question whether they have an art director or similar role. Audio has the same issue. I'm playing this and just feeling empty inside, like the game has no soul.

I'm honestly surprised in a bad way that they bothered to get advanced monetization systems and all the store UI going for the game before making the game playable to even an ok standard. This speaks a lot, to me.

To storm giants, I suggest making the game experience a higher priority than what it currently seems. I suggest stepping out of the shadow of the past you've been using as your main selling point so far, and sell a cool product that has soul in it.

To prospective players, I suggest saving your money to spend somewhere you'll have fun and enjoy your time. To me, that is not Stormgate as it stands. Let's hope it becomes that, in the future.",1723462200,2024-08-12 07:30:00

Don't regret my purchase, just want to tell it like it is. Skip, unless you're a huge RTS fan or want to support their team.

Early Access so lacking content, but the gameplay feels incredible. 

I do wish the artwork was more detailed and also more detailed animations. But I believe this is on the roadmap along with lots of other cool stuff.",1723412353,2024-08-11 17:39:13
steam,171923544,"Very fun and intuitive game. 

The most important word is FUN. Its an absolute blast",1723410943,2024-08-11 17:15:43
steam,171923318,"I mean it's an early access title, so there are some things that can change. But I really have a bad feeling about this game's future, I've waited until I can buy it on Steam and didn't back the devs before.

The 4,2 Hours I played were:

- All campaign missions so far on difficulty medium
-1 game 1v1 Vs Ai
-1 game 1v1 vs a human

Pros:

-- No crashes
-only one screen freeze for 30 seconds in the final mission when deploying those things for the tornadoes

-- Pathing worked most of the time relatively good
-this could be a skill issue but in the 1v1 against a human my two headed infernal guys had large issues pathing towards the ranged units of the other guy(some celestial dudes with large guns idk)

-- Didn't find any bug so far, the campaign worked from start to finish


Cons:

-- The writing of the campaign is really silly and I really hope they will change a lot about it
-the writing feels sloppy and I really don't care if anything would happen to any of the characters, they are a forgettable bunch and the dialogue is stale. 
-The main character has some weird interactions, one that comes to mind: MC rescues a treasure hunter that wants to bail and threathens her with a gun to enter their transporter. What makes this scene really silly is that there is a gigantic onslaught of fucking demons coming, so why the hell does that woman want to leave in the first place? A death wish?

-- Items for the main character
- I don't realy get why this is in the game, it feels like an attempt to add more depth to the game but it fails in my eyes, there was two instances I remember in this forgettable campaign where it was used for something mission related. One time the tornado thing and in another mission you have to use repair kits on broken vehicles.

--Ugly artstyle
- Sorry but the cutscenes look really bad, the soulless eyes and janky movements man...
- It remembers me of the trainwreck that was Dauntless, but that's just my personal trauma
- From above when you play the game it's okay but once I look at the units close up it's pretty ugly

Stuff that worries me:

-- Future campaigns to buy
- So in game I have the campaign as a ""bought"" item, so far so good. Starcraft 2 also had campaigns you had to buy after release. BUT the campaign so far was really lackluster and barely worth 10 bucks, fuck... Chapter 1, the one I own has 3 missions, THREE. Chapter 0 also has three missions, that#s it. If I have to pay 10 bucks whenever a new 3 mission ""campaign"" releases I won't buy those.

-- 10 Bucks Heroes to buy
- I didn't play the co-op mode so i don't know how fun it is or how important a hero is there but i got two from buying the game. Each other hero costs 10 bucks, which is pricey in my eyes.


I really hope the game manages to get better and prove me wrong, I was actually really hyped for a new RTS game",1723410675,2024-08-11 17:11:15

steam,171920494,"While I do not have a ton of time as of writing this review. I have enjoyed my time thus far in playing it. The campaign as many point out is a weak point so far of this game after launching into EA. I can agree that a lot of work needs to be done still to make it as good as SC2 type of campaign but, I have trust in the team to fix many of the communities issues with the campaign and Frost Gaint has stated they are not finished with the first 6 missions they released in EA so there is hope to see a far better campaign in the future but if this is your main draw you most likely will not enjoy it if you expect SC2 level of production and quality. It simply is not there yet.

The CO-OP 3vAI is still very much a work in progress as to be expected with launching 3 different types of game modes. For example: Campaign, 3vAI co-op and the 1v1 mode. It is difficult for them to address all issues at once with these different game modes in the at the launch of EA. The rate of progress is a bit slow as others have stated but I think they will be tuning this so its not such a grind. I think giving the players easier and quicker access to the final levels of a hero is critical in keeping players engaged. Otherwise I don't think many players will make it to level 10 on their heroes unless they just really like it and don't mind the grind. But, I still look forward to playing it more with what little time i do get for games at this time in my life.

I have yet to play 1v1s as I like to get more prepared to understand the build orders and what units are able to counter who in certain match-ups I tend to over analyze this type of game mode as I like to come to it over prepared before jumping into it. I had a similar issue with SC2 and Wings of Liberty when it launched. But also a little less so with it because I had friends at the time to play with in other modes like 2v2s and 3v3s as well to learn in. I rarely use 1v1s to learn right away with RTS's. 

In closing this game is very much still in EA and even when it goes F2P it won't be different on Aug 13th. I would say 3 months from now we can start to see a much better product before us and trust in Frost Gaint to deliver a great game to us. But, only buy a support pack if understand this and have played a little before hand. Otherwise you will most likely end up displeased and want a refund because this game still has a good ways to go before it's a more ""polished"" experience to SC2.",1723407649,2024-08-11 16:20:49

steam,171917094,"In the name of countering the bad reviews outweighing the good ones, I honestly really enjoy where they're coming from with this game. It's still lacking some polish, and I'm sure there's a lot to be done, but you can't compare a brand new RTS to one that has literally been around for decades when it comes to bugs and gameplay balance. On the surface it looks like Starcraft with some changes, but there are A LOT of minute differences that really add up. I really like the game, and I like that (AS THE DEVS HAVE STATED) it's supposed to be a slower-paced game than Starcraft's ""dead because of a half-second mistake"" gameplay. I don't regret backing it at all, and I bought the highest level package that didn't have physical perks. The devs have delivered exactly what they promised to backers, and are doing everything they can to do right by the players.",1723404044,2024-08-11 15:20:44

steam,171915936,"lets be honest, a lot of things are not perfect and not original, yeah, buts its ""early"" early access and the devs already started taking our requests and feedback to heart. it has a lot of potential and the unique angel faction shows what is capable in the future. the gear system and turf war in coop are smart changes in comparison to other games and make it a lot of fun. for everyone who seeks a full functional game should give it a year til its out of early access but for the rest i recommend supporting this game",1723402804,2024-08-11 15:00:04

steam,171904774,"I really like the 1v1 and the co-op is fun, I haven't tried the campaign and probably won't, I'm looking forwards to the 3v3 mode though

Early scouting units make cheese risky and creep camps discourage turtling, it feels like being active on the map and adapting to ur opponent is the best way to play while turtling and cheese are still viable, though less effective than in some other games, and I think that's pretty cool : )",1723391375,2024-08-11 11:49:35

There, I'm pleasantly surprised by how seamless it feels to play and how the new mechanics bring a lot of variety to the game. I'll wait for the game to leave early access for my final verdict but seeing how it's going so far, I think I'll stick with the game for a long time to come.

As of this moment:
Campaign feels half baked, there are some good improvements in the roadmap but the story is not that interesting and the characters aren't that compelling. Pretty standard RTS missions, but the 3-6 missions were much more fun that the first 3. 
Co-op is very much like SC2, which is good. Excited as they flesh out the commanders and maps more, but what's there is a nice foundation. I play this mode the most.
1v1 is a really great experience. The core gameplay is solid and they will continue to get better.

Some missions are ok but others are just poor versions of a warcraft III/diablo dungeon and you get bored very quickly, running around and just hoping it's not gonna be too long. If I wanted to play dungeons, I'd play any RPG instead. I have to say that the theme of ""angels vs demons"" is not interesting and as a result the story is poor.

steam,171896515,"When I heard the developer story of Frost Giant and StormGate I was very hyped.

First disappointment came with the announcement trailer. Looked very bland, and not too promising.

Next disappointment came with the Terran... Err I mean Vanguard announcement. There are a million ways to make a human race unique and oh wait it's space marines again.

Next disappointment came with the Zer- well Infernal Host announcent. It's more unique than Zerg but holy crap it's vile evil aliens coated in flames instead of goo.

Next disappointment came with the Kickstarter FOMO packages. $60 for goodies you'll never be able to get again if you don't buy it.

Next disappointment came with the graphics. Plastic, weirdly stylized, odd unit/building design choices, really, really bad cincematics. The character design is also really soulless. These aren't heroes we'll fall in love with like Kerrigan, or Yasuo, or Solas.

Next dis- ehh even though it's totally-not-Protoss high-tech aliens, the Celestials are quite okay from what I've seen. 

Next disappointment came with the campaign. God damnit.

Hide behind the ""alpha"" card all you want, you said the stylized design is final, there's no way you'll flip the races all over, and you already hurt your community by shadow editing the FAQ, not delivering on promises and the game direction you're taking.

We hoped for the next big RTS and got StarCraft 1.5. I really hope one day this review would get bombed with ""lmao this aged like milk"" and ""how could you have been so wrong"" comments. Play AoE4, or AoM:Retold, or StarCraft II if you're tempted. This ain't it right now.",1723383416,2024-08-11 09:36:56
steam,171896370,"UPDATED REVIEW:

Following the most recent patch, I am now confident in the direction the Stormgate team is taking the game. The game has made massive strides in visual presentation, and the plan the team has laid out for the visual overhaul of both Vanguard and Infernals makes both factions far more compelling. 

I now believe that the team has both a strong vision for the final game and the ability to deliver on this vision, and so I am changing my review to Recommended, keeping in mind that this is an Early Access title. 

======================
ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:


I've exclusively played the co-op mode, and to be honest, at the moment it doesn't really grab me in any way. The game audio and visuals (I like the stylization, so when I say ""visuals"", I am referring to the level of polish) feel quite amateurish at this time. Voice work in the game doesn't sound like it's being delivered by a skilled professional voice actor. I don't know enough to say if this is the result of the acting itself or of the audio mixing, but either way, it takes me out of the game. As for the visuals, the maps feel pretty flat and unfinished, as do a lot of the units. I like stylized design, but it feels like everything needs a lot more polish. 

Gameplay-wise, the co-op mode feels underwhelming as well. There's a lack of ""splashy"" abilities and unlocks which are so fun in SC2 co-op. Co-op feels like it has a ""PvP"" balancing mentality right now, in terms of keeping abilities from being too powerful, which is disappointing for a PvE mode. I'm not really excited when I use most of the hero/top bar abilities in PvE, and there's not a lot on the unlock list which sounds very exciting either. 

As someone who is mostly interested in the ""fun factor"" and aesthetic feel of the game, and doesn't play PvP, this has overall left me feeling pretty disengaged from the game at the moment. I'm interested in following development, but I don't feel a strong pull to play the game. 

I don't regret spending the money, as it was done with the mentality of supporting development, and I am hoping to change this to a positive review in the future if and when Frost Giant makes big strides in improving the game throughout Early Access, but right now it's clear that the game needs a LOT of work.",1723383232,2024-08-11 09:33:52
steam,171896330,I love how the game is coming along with smooth gameplay as well as look and feel! Especially having the more accessible controls for new players while keeping the grind real for seasoned players is something I've really been looking forward to!,1723383193,2024-08-11 09:33:13

steam,171889897,"I ve been a beta tester since last year and also extensively read the communications of frostgiant on both their discord and subreddit, amongst other official channels. While i yearn for a new good rts I have sadly come to the conclusion that i cant in good faith endorse this game. This is mainly due to the shady business practices of the developer ""frostgiant"". I will make this clear on two examples:

1) During kickstarter release they used the phrase ""funded till release"" numerous times to show the security of their financial backing. It was later revealed that this phrase ""funded till release"" only meant funding till early access. This was admitted and clarified on their official subreddit. This is unacceptable, since people bought in due to that understanding. 


2) Again during kickstarter they sold packages with the claim ""all the content of year zero"", with year zero being defined as the period of early access. This was later ninja edited to mean a severely reduced content, backers who bought this package didnt even get all the content present at early access launch. They later apologised for this and while they wont give out all the content for free, they will give out an additional hero for free during early access to those backers. However this still doesnt aknowledge backers who bought the more expensive packages with the impression that all content during early access would be free. Furthermore in their ""apology"" they pushed the burden onto the backers for not reading correctly. This coupled with the ninja edit and the previous incident paints a company that is more interested in scamming their fans and kickstarter supporters, than do right by those who supported them early. 

I have additional issues with the game, but due to those shady businesss practices, i couldnt, even if i would look past them, endorse this game in good  fashion.

A further note, the game has had over 35 Million in funding so far and has a ""burn rate"" of over 15 million a year, i am very skeptical that this game can survive even one year on steam, without drastically downscaling the experience.

RTS fans looking for a next gen experience should look elsewhere.",1723375837,2024-08-11 07:30:37

steam,171861134,"Stormgate is a very promising RTS that has potential to be a great esport game.  I have looked at a few of the upcoming RTS games and to me this is the best for competitive play.  It feels like you have a lot of control over the units and capability to execute micro tactics along with managing the macro aspects of the game.  In some other RTS games the individual units feel clunky, get stuck on each other too much, or always want to move in formations.  This is fine for campaign games, but for multiplayer I think it is important to be able to quickly manipulate all the little movements and abilities to get that edge.  Stormgate gets this right.
There are three factions in the game and I’ve been playing Vanguard, which is the human faction.  I really like how the units synergize with each other and themselves.  Frontline units have abilities that make them stronger when they are attacked, rear units have abilities to help them stutter step, drop ships have escape abilities, and so on.  This might sound like obvious design decision, but even the biggest RTS games haven’t always felt like they get this right.  
There is a lot of creativity in the game already.  Units that can split into smaller units, bunkers defenses that take on different properties based on the units manning them, supply stations that can be customized to increase the effectiveness of nearby buildings and so on.  
Each faction has its own macro mechanics that make them even more unique.  Vanguard units level up and become more powerful as they win fights and survive.  Infernals can turn killed units into an undead swarm.  The celestials start with a flying main base that and can more easily build around the map.
We don’t know what all the units and abilities are yet, but Stormgate is shaping up to be a game with the right feel for high level play with three very unique factions that are fun to play.

There is other matters i picked up on with the campaign but frost giant has already started working on the issue give the Campaign time to bake and i would say it be worth getting. On the scale out of 1-10  1 being low 10 being high i would give an 8 and frost giant are pro active with patches balance and other matters that happen. even though i think the game has released to early in X amount of time i would say stormgate will be in early access where the game will be fun for all campaign works  lots of content,1723317708,2024-08-10 15:21:48

steam,171836658,"Stormgate had high expectations but it falls short in its current early access state in almost every regard. The competitive 1v1 mode shows some promise as it's quite enjoyable but, just like the rest of the game, it lacks the polish needed to stand out. Units move mechanically, almost as if on rails, and the animations feel stiff and lifeless, draining any excitement from the gameplay. What's more, all of the units just feel like rehashed versions of things we have seen in other games many times before. There's no love or care in how the game presents itself, which is disappointing for a team with such a legacy behind it.

The campaign is, quite frankly, a total disaster. The story is dull, and the attempt at humor often comes off as cringeworthy rather than clever. The cutscenes are especially hard to watch, with grotesque character models and poorly animated interactions akin to mobile game quality than that of a ""next-generation RTS"". So far, the narrative is a creatively bankrupt rehash of ideas from StarCraft and WarCraft mashed together into a loveless pile of doodoo.

Whenever Frost Giant is asking for money, they love to flaunt their extensive experience as former Blizzard devs and makers of StarCraft 2 and WarCraft 3. But when the high expectations they set aren't met, they conveniently shift the narrative, reminding everyone that they are ""just a small indie studio"" (despite a $35 million budget).

It's hard to recommend this game to anyone but hardcore competitive RTS players at this point, even once it's free to play.",1723306517,2024-08-10 12:15:17

steam,171831408,"This game looks like it could be fun, but there are a couple of things that really ruin my experience.

First and foremost, I'm sick of people releasing unfinished games. As a developer, I think it's an incredibly messed up practice that typically gets people hooked to buy something that eventually gets under-delivered.

Second, I can't be the only one here... Why is everything always so zoomed in?  I cannot stand how much real estate is wasted on this game. It's like sitting on a Windows desktop at 1080p @ 300% scaling. 

Third, I can't stand that map navigation controls are mapped to the middle mouse button and arrow keys. In order to get any appeasement out of this I need to keep my left hand on the arrows (or remap those controls).  Westwood had the absolute best controls for managing units, with right click drag from center to move the camera. The whole camera control system feels very cloogy and it leaves a lot to be desired.",1723301410,2024-08-10 10:50:10

steam,171823713,"Update due to new patch: The game looks better, but it's still not fun.

RTS is Dead.

Wait a minute and let me explain. 

I used to be a hardcore RTS player. Ex-Grand Master on SC2; made it to the top 1000 players in the world, and have been playing RTS since Warcraft 1; so I've got a reasonably informed opinion here.

The main issue I have with this game is that it's meant to be designed to attract new players to the genre by making the game more FUN! 

FUN! RIGHT?! 

Well... it's failed in that goal miserably. Because in 1v1 mode, whilst the controls are more simple, and there's a buddy bot system to help new players get started, it is still a massive grind to learn what units work well against others and because they've really toned down all of the fights by making HP higher and Damage lower, it's really difficult to tell what units actually do anything in a fight. Making the whole game much harder for a new player to grasp.

I'm almost 50 hours in and I'm starting to learn all of the subtle balance things that come with getting good at RTS. I just wish they made the game play (the fights) more exciting and obvious whilst explaining to players in the CODEX what is good vs what (or what the ideas behind the unit design choices are). 

Alas, the choice of slowing the fights down doesn't have the desired goal of making fights easier, it just makes them more boring. 

Another issue is the zoom. Warcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 had slower fights, but they were smaller armies and the camera was a little more zoomed in. You can zoom in on this game but then you're at a disadvantage to your opponent if you do so it doesn't make sense. The idea behind a more zoomed in game is to focus on micro with less troops. But this game just has large globs of troops and even if I use 3 different groups to encircle my opponent, the potential for micro kinda sucks because it's not zoomed in enough to get a good read on the fight, and it's really hard to tell what units are being effective vs those that aren't...

So yeah... RTS is dead.

But I still recommend this game if you like RTS. It's a grind, it's not that fun, but it's something new and worth a try.",1723293800,2024-08-10 08:43:20

These are really the only modes worth playing at this time, and I’d say you’d really need to be a StarCraft 2 and/or WarCraft 3 fan.

As for the positives, the game works most of the time and I’m having a lot of fun, it’s scratching my itch for a new RTS, it has widescreen support right off the bat, and thus far the developers are listening and answering issues brought up.
For example, they already released a pretty big balance patch one a week into the early preview for us early adopters. I thought they’d wait until Early Access started for all. They also did a great job with that patch and explaining why they made this or that balance change — along with bug fixes and what not.

I wanted to also mention that I bought the $60 dollar edition in order to support the company.

steam,171800009,"Good RTS Game. I'm a fan.

Ignore the negativity. The bad reviews are frankly just sad people who do this to literally every new RTS.

The RTS Genre has some of the absolute worst ""fans"" in the world. They will whine and moan and complain about a lack of RTS games but the second a new one comes out that isn't EXACTLY what they imagined on Day One or has new strategies they have to learn, they will instantly jump on every social media platform in the world and trash it wherever it is being talked about and bad mouth it. They even do it to the RTS they are all claiming in the comments here they are going to go back to playing (SC2).

It is perplexing to me. Who has so much free time in their lives that they can dedicate a huge portion of it to hate-stalking an entire genre of games? 

Youtube, Reddit, Discord, everywhere this game is mentioned these people with 0.2 hours played will be there talking about how bad it is. And they think you should trust their opinion, afterall, they played for 12 minutes.

Ignore them. They did this to AoE4, CoH3, and DoW3 (all of which had problems but were good at their core and not worthy of the level of vitriol they got). They will burn down every RTS that comes out. This genre is dead if people let those fans rule it. 

Stormgate is a good RTS. They have a ways to go until 1.0. But where it is now is a very solid 1v1 or Co-Op vs AI RTS. It is getting better over time. The Developers listen to the community.

My biggest point of feedback is that you cant tell what a unit is supposed to do when you look at them. if you look at a zergling, their claws are slightly exaggerated. Same for a zealot or a Baneling. The design of the characters follows their function very well. In some case the function can be assumed, like a Marine with a gun, we can make direct connections to our realities, but we cannot in the cases of the more fantasy leaning units. An Overlord LOOKS like the most useless flying cow and that's exactly what it is. For example, Stormgates 4 legged tall character for the fire units (cant remember the name) has an ability like the sc2 Viper to pull units from the back lines.

Campaign: The missions were exactly more or less what you would expect from an RTS, but something about the narrative seems reaaaally familiar to Warcraft III, but I won't mention spoilers. 

The Races: It does feel loosely terran, protoss, zerg ish.

Co-OP: The Co-op format mission style is exactly the same as Starcraft 2. Some of the co-op missions themselves are exactly the same starcraft.  Stop the convoys, assault the bad guys during the day and survive the night assault, etc. I might as well just play Starcraft 2 for that.

no custom map editor?

steam,171748538,"Disclaimer: I have not played the campaign and have no interest in it at this time due to the negative reviews and generally being more of a 1v1 enjoyer. I don't see myself ever purchasing the campaign even when it is finished. Unless it turns out Godlike, or something.

With that out of the way...

I played a LOT of Warcraft 3 and Starcraft (both Brood War and 2) back in my youth so RTS games always had a warm place in my heart. I mostly played custom games (and map editor!) but started to really get into 1v1 once Starcraft 2 came around and loved it, eventually making it to high Plat (was so close to Diamond before I got sucked into World of Warcraft... anyway).

Seeing the team at Frost Giant and watching some gameplay from the Frigate build I decided to purchase one of the early access packs to try it out and support a developer I saw trying to bring back those WC/SC glory days. Nostalgia? Probably. But the thought of a new Blizzard styled RTS with consistent, modern updates tickled me.

So, I tried some matches. Here are my thoughts.

GRAPHICS
A contentious topic from my online perusals. Me, personally, I like it. It has that Warcraft cartoony look with clear visuals, which is the important part for me. It's easy to see what is happening and what is what. The terrain, however, could use a little more detail and it can feel a bit disconnected when it is super advanced humans in mechs and stuff fighting tech-angels... In a magical forest :P The blend of sci-fi and fantasy is a fun aesthetic, but sometimes it feels a bit too jarring.

GAMEPLAY
Hooo boy, this is the good stuff. Snappy, clear and fun as all heck. It is clear that the team at Frost Giant know how to make a great competitive RTS. Pathing can have some hiccup but even WC/SC could be wonky at times. I never had an issue in battles I couldn't solve with some extra micro, though. The introduction of creep camps that give resources as well as map-wide buffs when you control them had me cautious at first but now I can say I am all aboard. It changes the dynamic of each match and gives you incentives to go out on the map and, once you grab a few, protect them to keep their powerful buffs for yourself (or out of the enemies hands!) Overall the gameplay carries the game hard, and that is a damned good thing. It's addictive!

BALANCE
Balance is hard, especially with 3 unique factions (and the Celestials, what even is this race?) and there were definitely some strategies that were busted and dumb. However, with the latest 0.0.1 balance patch I was given a large sense of relief. It was clear from the notes and comments around it (super appreciated btw, Frost Giant, most companies just chuck the notes at you and leave it at that) that they understand their game very well and didn't ""kneejerk reaction"" any of the changes. My limited games with the new changes felt better and I'm quite impressed with how balanced the game feels even in such an early state. I have high hopes and I believe Frost Giant can keep the game competitive even with some of the more wacky and creative things they are putting into the game. Balance changes, for the good and bad, but so far I am impressed with the 1v1 balance!

COOP
Only played a few matches and got a hero to level 4 (so not much time in it). It's fun, haven't tried the harder difficulties but I can see myself having fun in it as a low stakes pastime. Once the game goes F2P I'll definitely try and get my casual friends to try it out with me! I believe this mode still needs more work; more variety, more interesting objectives, etc. But I don't have enough reps in to concretely offer anything of value.

MONETIZATION
An elephant in the room of all F2P games. The campaign, from what I read, is nowhere near ready enough to pay money for. Maybe in the future it will be, but I'm not a big campaign guy so that doesn't mean much to me, personally. The coop commanders being 11-12 bucks (Canadian) stings a bit, a few commanders and that's the cost of a full indie title! No clue on army themes and the like, so we'll have to see. They have said no P2W and I'm hoping they keep that promise. They have to make money, I get that, but I hope they don't go down the route of gouging where they can.

THE FUTURE
I think the future is bright for Stormgate. The bones here are excellent, they just need to build up and polish what they have and this will be a game I play for years and years. I'm eagerly awaiting the map editor so the community can do what RTS communities do best: make some great maps and modes! I'll be playing well into early access and I am excited to see where this goes.

If you read all the way to the end then you are crazy, beautiful and I hope you have a great day!

steam,171746530,"I was part of early testing for this game, and honestly, I can't see this game releasing within the next year. It feels extremely unfinished and unpolished.

Some things I noticed playing recently:
1. The game feels flat. Sound effects are missing in simple places and it harms the experience of the game significantly.
Example: Buildings make no sounds when clicking on them. When you start to build units, units make no sound that you're making units. Build times on units don't exist... The entire system feels horrible.
2. Factions are incredibly imbalanced and the new Celestial race is...... awful. 
3. Maps are way too large. Creeping on maps detracts heavily from an RTS Experience.
4. Unit pathing is weird. Unit movement feels flat and odd (similar to the sound).

Out of the 3 gamemodes I've played so far (campaign, coop, and 1v1), campaign is by far the worst, but that doesn't mean there aren't any good features in the mode.

The first 2 missions also felt way more boring and bland than rest but that could be as a result of the chapter 0 missions to be intended to be used as tutorial missions. 

The main hero, Amara, is way too op since on most missions, even on brutal difficulty, I could solo the whole mission by just using her. I don't think this encourages the nature of a rts game in the campaign. Obviously, the models in the cutscenes need work. They don't have lip sync animations added yet and their appearance look a bit weird. However, I believe the developers said they weren't going to use in game models for the finalised cutscenes so hopefully it looks better. I also felt that I wasn't that emersed into the Stormgate universe when playing because the campaign menu felt like the mission archives from starcraft 2's WOL campaign. I think this could be improved if an in-game interface was somehow added. 

As others might've pointed out, the story seems a bit similar to Warcraft but I can't really predict what the developers are going to add so it seems better to wait for more missions before criticising the storyline.

Even though I have only played through hard and brutal, I like how they added beginner and normal modes as an option. I think this will give newer players a better experience in playing the campaign. I also liked how they improved the replayability of the missions. For example, they changed the type of enemies that could spawn in each mission and the brutal difficulty has to be unlocked by playing the mission with another difficulty first. The mission i enjoyed the most was mission 5 because of the replayability of that mission.

Overall, I would recommend to wait until the 1.0 release if you want a finished campaign but it is still somewhat enjoyable in the current version.


Co-op
With Co-op, I've only played 3-4 games with other players, and I like how the game forces you to move out on the map whether its a timer you need to do an objective by or attack waves you need to clear. The attack waves aren't small sized waves that one person can clear by themselves so it forces players to work together which is also a cool feature. Although I've only played blockade, i don't think theres many ways to cheese or break the missions which is also another good sign. 
Even though there are 6 different co-op maps, there are only 4 main co-op modes. The one feature i didn't like too much that was changed from the last beta test was they changed it so that the whole map is a black fog of war. This means that you can't view the terrain and also where the creep camps are. 

I do like how theres an option for buddybot and the ability to play solo. I think the buddybot option is good for newer players since it gives helpful macro but the downside is you can't tell it to not build a building or unit. Basically using buddybot means you're stuck on one opening and you can't control the strategy you're going for. However, I love using the solo mode option since i find co-op missions to be way more fun and interesting. This is because usually in normal co-op missions, if everyone's army gets past a certain supply, it is really hard to lose but in solo mode, even if the army becomes a decent size, there is still a good chance to lose the mission.

Overall I enjoy playing coop (both solo and multiplayer) and like the coop missions.


1v1 (Vanguard)
I've played around 40 games in the 1v1 mode since early release, hovering around the 1700 mmr range. In my opinion, I like the diverse options that I can choose to use in each matchup. This is good so my games won't be repetitive and boring. Each strategy also seems to flow with the pace of the game really well and the upgrades system is also well designed. I especially like how researching one upgrade can unlock another upgrade to research, but i feel this isn't well indicated to newer players who might completely miss the fact that there are other upgrades. 

In terms of unit design, i feel like every unit plays a vital role in the game. For example, an ideal late game vanguard army would include nearly every combat unit. However, i do feel like the exo is a bit too good as with the quickdraw hustle army, it can kite almost any unit and this could make the game unfun for the opponents. Additionally, from the vanguard perspective, the argent feels really underpowered since it gets outtraded too hard.

Generally the unit movement feels smooth and you can usually set up successful surrounds against the opponent. However, the pathfinding still needs some work as when I tell my bobs to build a building, they keep getting stuck on each other and won't contribute to finishing the building.

Currently, the creep camps are really impactful early game since each creep camp gives around 200 luminite as well as a passive boost. The luminite earned from the early creep camp could mean your build order is sped up, resulting in a faster timing attack or a larger army mass. As a result, I like the fact that creep camps encourage players to move out on the map early since taking the enemy creep camp could mean a huge advantage. However, as the game goes on, there doesn't feel like much incentive to capture creep camps that you aren't going to pass by since the luminite gained doesn't feel worth the time that could've been used to apply pressure to the enemy.

Overall, I enjoy the 1v1 mode as Vanguard but there are still a lot of things to work on to make the gamemode better.


Graphics
I don't mind the graphics since everything in big fights are readable but I can see why some people might dislike the artstyle. It took sometime for me to get used to it but after playing for some time, I naturally zone out the artstyle. I also think some models like the exo as well as unit abilities such as the quickdraw hustle abilities look really cool and are definitely an improvement to the graphics shown in previous beta tests.",1723201323,2024-08-09 07:02:03

steam,171727389,"Very fun addition to the RTS genre. I've been playing primarily multiplayer and having a great time.

Often compared to Sc2 (naturally) but I feel like this one will stand on its own. The combat pace is a little slower / units take longer to die which imo makes the micro a bit more approachable and lends itself to big flashy fights.

There's a bit of early access scuff but the devs are very actively engaged listening to feedback and are getting updates out quickly.

I am pretty much a strict PVP player but the gameplay loop has been super satisfying and it always feels like theres a few easy things I can adjust to get better.

steam,171723156,"I have pretty high hopes for this game. Combat was fluid felt clean (albeit a bit slower?)like in sc2.

Game obviously needs a ton of polish and over time I hope the world continuously get fleshed out, however it reminds me of early sc2. I think the bones are solid in this one and the development team seems dedicated; as long as it continues development at this pace I have high hopes for the game.

As for the negatives: currently some combat abilities feel pretty niche or unimpactful. this coupled with the removal of armor/weapon upgrades (which i think in concept the removal of these can work fine) end up with technology often being overlooked or overshadowed. This can end up with a type of brute force game play, where you are not tempted to risk a large technology investment that will pay out as material throughout the game later in lieu of just expanding and pumping units.",1723172718,2024-08-08 23:05:18

steam,171712604,"If you are looking for a drop in replacement for StarCraft 2 (like I was), you'll possibly find it hard to get used to.

Like others have said, the campaign is a bit weak and the game overall has a bit of a way to go. Today's patch notes seem to address quite a few issues/observations.

I was still undecided about the game, even being 20 PvP matches in, at the time. Losing most, but winning some, coming away from the battle with mixed feelings. Thinking ""This game is weird"". But as I slowly learn the intricacies of the game and the actual depth to it, it is starting to grow on me and beginning to make sense. Even though I have a long way to go still. Every game, I learn something new and think ""Ah, that's cool. This will be handy to know for next game"".

The pace of the game takes getting used to also. It's a mix of very slow and very frantic. Setting up the economy is pretty slow and I find expanding takes quite a while to do. But when the battles start up, you have to have you mind on point and you are clicking all over the place to not get smashed.

Now 27 hours in, I am finding the game to be quite enjoyable and look forward to seeing what the future brings. It's one of those games that you really need to be open minded and learning the mechanics, before you can start to really enjoy it. Just go in expecting to lose for a dozen PvP games or so and experiment with the units. At first you'll undoubtedly get rushed. But the worker units are actually quite robust and will be able to hold that off easily (compared to how they get 'popped' in SC2), so don't be afraid to use them.

The Co-op games are quite fun too and are another avenue to experimentation. In some of these games you'll see close resemblance to SC2 co-op missions (""Dead of Night"" for example).

For me, I'm liking Stormgate but can understand that it might not be for everyone. But what game is, really?

streamer mode, which enables chatting with others (i hated that in sc2) and there is a leaderboard and leagues.

steam,171709953,"Early Access Review - 4.5/10

OG RTS Player with thousands of hours in all the original RTS games from the 90's and early 00's. I didn't play PVP yet. That's not why I play RTS games. Sadly, that seems to be every game now which really ruins a lot of the aspects or original recipe that made the genre popular.

The talent and group behind this game is phenomenal and they deserve the time to make this game right. But it is far from right. This is very early access, borderline Beta. Though I don't have a ton of insight, nearly all RTS games play the same so there is no real reason to beat a dead horse with random sentences about the game itself.

NOTE: Review is based on Campaign only. This game did NOT draw me in.

Pros:

- Great art, color and overall look and feel. You can jump right in and feel at home like all good RTS's should bne
- GUI, Menu design and FOV is pretty spot on. Needs decent tweaking, but a solid starting point to improve upon
- Unit veterancy, building queue's, base layout work well. Hero's are still a little confusing, but exciting to see grow
- Pathing is nearly identical to the 90's games
- 3 Factions jumps right into the go big or go home category of RTS. Hopefully the story line and actual Campaign grows off of this
- Visual fidelity and graphics are great. Game runs smoothy. 

Cons: (Sorry, not sorry devs)

- Pathing is still the same as the 90's! Many times units marched to their death or go lost/stuck 
- Clunky UI. Sometimes you need a keyboard, sometimes you can click. Sometimes you can do both or only 1. Need
- No world view FOV. All of these games have the same FOV. I don't have a 4K monitor to not zoom out and see the entire map. We arent stuck on 768P. If I'm forced to micro manage, let me see the map in it's entirety.
- Poor art direction. Feels like a cheap Android clone of a better RTS game. Game feels rushed maybe
- No idea what half the things I do in the game satisfies. I can speed run the campaigns if needed and no idea how or if it even changes the story line


I could go on, but I prefer to leave it basic for now. This game seems like a really hard mashup between Old and New. Age old talent vs newer trends and directions. This is the problem we all face. When you mixed decades of players together. I personally see too much simplified, quick designs taking place of what was difficult and artful. Now that it's easier, you can churn it out faster and it looses it's passionate feel. This feels very ""someone who put money up is impatient per usual and wants to see something!""

This is not it! Capitol is fickle, so be careful or this might be dead before it arrives. The team has the ability and talent. I really hope they can find that fire again and recreate something truly worth of hundred of hours of gameplay",1723153953,2024-08-08 17:52:33
steam,171708885,"I can definitely understand the negative reviewers' frustrations, especially if some of them have invested into the development of the game. If you're looking for a campaign comparable to SC2's, you'll be disappointed. Then again, and even though they are ex-blizz devs, I doubt anything will compare to the characters, cinematics, and story concepts of StarCraft (obviously not counting any of the Warhammer RTS stories.) The characters are not nearly as memorable, the voice acting is a little eh. And in regards to the complaints that the game didn't deliver on what was promised - it's 2024 get used to this type of thing. 
I am also a little upset that they don't have the custom games, as we all loved Nexus Wars, Zealot Vs Probe, Dota, etc., but I am sure they'll (hopefully) get around to adding this feature to the game. 
That all being said, I think the pvp is really refreshing. There were a lot of concepts taken from SC2 and some from Warcraft (and even some similar voice lines lol) that were either improved or mixed into the game. So far I've really only tried to get better as the human faction, but little things like the bunkers' defense capabilities changing depending on what infantry unit you place into them, mixing WC's lumber mill system into the game (the rocks you can harvest are similar to lumber or vespene) where you can place the structure next to the harvested resource and boost gathering efficiency, mobs that you can kill for extra currency that are guarding keypoint like healing stations and visibility towers on the map, and the benefits that come with starting with a scouting unit - eliminating the need to send one of your little probe/scv babies out looking for the enemy. 
The game most DEFINITELY has a lot of room for improvement, so I suppose go ahead and wait for that prior to purchasing if you really want to. Like I said, I think custom modes, matches larger than 1v1, and possibly some balances are definitely needed (and honestly, the campaign is done and I think their energy would be better spent on the aforementioned aspects, but I digress) but I do think Stormgate could rise to the occassion if they handle the coming months properly.
Just don't do us like FatShark did with Darktide - it's seen significant improvement but it has taken WAY too long to implement changes and they honestly could have learned from the release of VT2.

steam,171697021,"While the game is clearly in its alpha stage, I'm patient enough to wait for it to be developed fully. However, there are several significant reasons why I'm hesitant to recommend investing time and money into Stormgate at this point.

1. Financial Feasibility: The developers will likely need approximately ten times the current funding to transition Stormgate from a prototype into a full-fledged game. Although the project has the charm of an ambitious indie studio, the reality is that its team appears to be well-established professionals with significant personal financial responsibilities, like children's college funds and medical bills. Based in California, their living costs are presumably high, which might reflect on the game’s budget needs. While they've made economical use of their current resources, scaling up could require substantial additional investment. For a point of comparison, look at StarCraft 2's evolution from basic beginnings (you can find videos of ""closed"" prototypes on YT) to a celebrated title, which was a process that took about a decade and substantial financial backing.

2. Delivery of Promises: The game delivers on its promises in the most technical sense, but it does so minimally. While single-player missions are included, they're extremely basic. The addition of webtoons and other content seems underwhelming, and I suspect the quality won't improve much with future updates.

3. Lack of Distinctiveness: Currently, the game feels soulless and uninspired, best described as bland and derivative. Even with further development, it’s unclear what would make Stormgate stand out in a genre that still enjoys offerings like StarCraft 2.

In summary, while Stormgate has potential, the considerable investment required, minimal fulfillment of promises, and lack of unique features make it difficult to recommend at this stage.",1723139475,2024-08-08 13:51:15
steam,171696274,"Having an absolute blast playing.  So far favorite thing is how user friendly the macro is in comparison to other RTS like starcraft.  I am a casual at RTS so being able to micro my army while building units at the same time without individually clicking buildings or spam camera swapping is amazing.  Auto control groups sends units as soon as they are produced to groups 1 (all units), 2 (ground units) and 3 (air units).  Things like the building tab to select any structure without having to find a worker and the nearest worker builds it automatically or the research tab to start any available research without selecting the research building and same with the units tab.  For a casual like myself that ease of play makes me feel like a boss and gives me way more time to focus on the fun part fighting the battles.  I havn't used it much but there is a buddy bot you can turn on for some game types like co op it automatically builds main structures and units for you.  I found this really cool when learning the factions because I could spend my time reading what everything is while buddy bot built a pretty diverse base and kept a steady flow of diverse units.  I also do not mind the cartoony feel I hope they improve the graphics over time but the style of the art i rather enjoy looking at.

If I treat this early access period as an open beta - which it is - then this game is truly great. Is it StarCraft II yet? No, but it's on a tangible trajectory to eventually be a more fun competitive game.

As a major PvP RTS fan, I'm enjoying this game a ton and I'm rooting for it to succeed.",1723138085,2024-08-08 13:28:05

I am frankly shocked that they thought they had something special with this. I got countless emails reminding me not to leak any details about this game after the Kickstarter campaign ended and early testing began, to the point that I started getting annoyed before I even played it, as I was waiting until it reached a solid foundational state to give it a shot.

It's ugly, it's uninteresting, it has no charisma or soul to it, it already has micro-transactions despite not even being fun to play. I feel more inclined to accept my loss and uninstall than to keep up with updates.

Shame on everyone involved with this Kickstarter and this project in general. I feel less like I helped struggling creators bring their project to life, and more like I was taken advantage of by a homeless ex-member of Wall Street greedily eyeing my wallet and planning his return to the mansion lifestyle. This is not what indie games are about.",1723136029,2024-08-08 12:53:49

The tech is there - game works and feels snappy, pathfinding is OK, rollback networking works, but everything else except maybe music seems to be missing, placeholder or completely borked (sounds, models, animations, voice acting, godawful cinematics..).
1v1 PvP could be worth your time even in this state, if its your thing. Everything else needs time (years) to improve. I hope it will.

steam,171688516,"This review is for SC2 ladder enjoyers. 

I played 1v1 competitive StarCraft 2 since 2011 at the mid Diamond rank. No game in the last 13 years has dethroned SC2, for me personally, until StormGate. I don't care about any game modes other than 1v1, so this review is only about that. 

Here are the quality of life improvements that speak to me directly:

Command Card: 
Instead of having to hotkey buildings and then switch to those hotkeys (or tab through them) in order to build units and uprgrades, you can use the Command Card. The Command Card automatically provides easy access to units and upgrades as they become available upon building completion. This is huge because you can rapidly build units between microing. Feels reaaaaally good.

Lowering the Time to Kill (TTK): 
One of the issues SC2 has is macroing for 7 minutes perfectly to basically then attack for a couple of seconds only to have an army be nearly completely wiped out in a second, leading to instant win/lose scenarios. This made for very frustrating games on average. StormGate's units have higher TTK so they last longer, leading to more micro management in a tactical sense, and therefore more strategy in general. Units also move slower. The game just feels less stressful but equally as exciting. 

Deeper mechanics:
I'll just briefly touch on 1 really interesting mechanic for each race. Vanguard's units can be promoted by the player after they gain experience, adding a layer of strategy and micro management where you want to keep your elite units alive over time. Infernal has infest, which means when they kill an infested unit, that unit spawns a tiny zerg like unit. It's actually incredible that an RTS company seems to have solved the ""free unit problem"" in an RTS. Celestials can move across the map producing buildings and units anywhere. This adds a layer of strategy to each map due to each map being a puzzle to solve. Playing on Random on the ladder is really fun.

Creep Colonies:
Edit: I have a new opinion. Creep camps are still a work in progress. After playing hundreds of hours they can get old, but I think they are changing them as we speak. 

The maps have creep colonies that, when killed, provide health, increased unit speed, resources, vision, etc. These creep colonies add another dimension of strategy. Vanguard units can kill a creep camp, promote their units, and gain the creep camp ability (increased vision, health, etc.). Infest units can kill a creep camp and gain units as the units that die spawn units. Celestials can literally fly to a creep camp in the beginning of the game and build their base in the camp. This adds a dimension of strategy where there are new interesting starting points from the vantage point of Celestials. 

They also solved ping issues between countries so that people can play each other around the world and have decent ping. This is some kind of sorcery that I don't understand but has huge implications for the ladder and tournaments, as this removes the need for regions. 

Cons:
The game is in early access so it's currently not complete. Tier 3 units are not out yet. The art is not finished. The sound is not finished. Some people do not like the art style, but I don't care because the 1v1 is really fun. The other game modes are far from complete. Playing a game with max unit comps does drop frames. This is the biggest one for me b/c an RTS needs to be buttery smooth for it to feel good. It runs well with DLSS all the way up until massive engagements.

This game is coming out free to play. If you like 1v1 RTS games like SC2, WarCraft 3, etc. then you should absolutely try it out. Just don't expect a complete game, and the other game modes may or may not be good.",1723130380,2024-08-08 11:19:40
steam,171684571,"I get the disappointment but I am not writing this game off either.  If you want a good RTS stand buy them and accept the outcome if you do.  The game has potential so I don't regret investing, in the meantime I'll be playing WC3 and Pyre when it releases.",1723126279,2024-08-08 10:11:19
steam,171684197,"This game is hard to judge currently. It's a early access game in a very divisive state. I backed the kickstarter because i am an RTS veteran and enthusiast even though i almost never use kickstarter, buy pre-order or buy product in early-access, preferring to wait for a fully released 1.0 product.
Going directly to the point, i will say that this game has a high potential, but currently you have to play 1v1 competitive mode to see that potential and most people who will play the Campaign will finish to have a bad impression, because Campaign mode is the worst mode currently and the mode in need of the more polishment and work. Let's take a look at the main pros and cons of the game in it's current early state:

Pros:

_ Responsive and fluid control engine. Clearly it shows that the developers took a lot of care
_ Servers: apparently servers have held up quite well the first early access phase. We will see  if this continuers to be true when the early access opens up for the general public at the 13 August.
_ Blizzard RTS feeling gameplay: this is probably the best part. The gameplay is pretty interesting and designed and while there are many borrowed ideas from prior Blizzard RTS classic, they are well mixed together and there are also some original ideas here and there (creep camps that respawns after some minutes giving a better bonus, the original way Therium - the advanced resource - is gradually generated and mined). Currently there 3 races and Vanguard is ispired from SC 2 Terrans, Infernal are a mix of WC 2 orcs and SC zergs and Celestial are probably the most original race with same mechanics borrowed from SC Protoss but also a different feeling.
_ No P2W for competitive 1v1 mode, at least currently. We shall see at 1.0' release.
_ The developer team is clearly struggling to try to make a more accessible competitive RTS while also keeping  a considerably high skill cap. Competetive RTS in fact have historically have had both a pretty high skill floor and the highest skill cap of all competitive video game genres, but while this can be quite attractive for RTS veterans and competitive games, at the same time it can demotivate many potential gamers that feel discuraged by a steep barrier of access. Lowering the skill floor by slowing down the pace of the battles and streamlining the command scheme (the general sub tabs that have been introduced to simplificate builing units and building and researching times

Supended judgement:

_ Hotkey customization is limited currently, but they already said they will improve this aspect
_ Game balance: of course it's still too early and it's quite normal to have balance problems in this phase of the development. In this phase testing and experimentation with creative ideas is more important than a good overall balance, which will matter much more once the game is ready to launch at 1.0 release. Celestials in particular, the last introduced race, seem a bit over the top and too cheese oriented at the moment. Same abilities like the exploding baneling-like infernal workers (imps) seems a bit out of place in a game were they openly said they want to slow down fights compared to SC 2 where you if distract for a few seconds at the wrong moment your army gets obliterated before you can take notice.
_ 3 player CO-OP mode: the basic skeleton of the mode is there, but it still needs a lot a work and polish. SC 2 CO-OP is better at the moment but we will have to wait the future to give a fair judgement to this mode.

Cons:

_ poor performance: the game is way too heavy and resource hunghry compared to the quality of it's graphics. SC 2 looks significanlty better and is better optimized.
_ graphics/visuals: i don't mind the cartoony style in a game like this unlike others (after all WC3 had cartony graphics and still is one of the best games of all times and a top 3 RTS game of all time), but apart of the style the visual of this game are still not there. SC 2 looks much better and is a game from 2010. I don't understand in general why RTS games struggle this much to evolve visually unlike most other videogame genres.
_ Monetization: this will be a F2P game from a business model standpoint, so they will have to found their project and company via microtransactions to cover development and maintenaice cost like server cost, and to eventually turn a profit. Currently you can buy some Campaign missions and some CO-OP commanders but their price is quite too expensive for what they offer compared to a full priced retail RTS. 10 dollar/&euros for 3/4 missions or a CO-OP commander seems too expensive. It would be reasonable to slice the price of these items by 30%/40%.
_ Campagin: this is the least ready mode currenlty and while there are some nice touches here and there, the presentation and the quality just isn't there right now. I also didn't like and found quite plain and not very memorable most of the characters in the Vanguard Campaign (some villains are better, but Amara and company aren't really memorable from the mission avaible right now and i also don't like the wierd design/frame and personality of most female characters honestly).

The next year will be critical for the succes (or better say the survival?) of the project and the developers need to deliver significat improvement during that spawn of time or i fear the probability of success of the project will lower considerably, given that there are many new RTS coming out in the next few years. For know i will give a positive review even though this is currently more of a mixed/neutral review to give the development team. But in the future if i won't see a significant improvement in the overall product especially from optimizationa and Campaign mode i may turn the review to negative.",1723125872,2024-08-08 10:04:32

- the art updates have been enormous strides in the right direction.
- 1v1 continues to evolve in healthy ways that make it way less of a pain in the ass to play than any other rts on the market.
- co-op is currently behind on updates but that's no surprise considering the other massive reworks that the other parts of the game have been undergoing. it's still a lot of fun and has a lot of content to it, so that doesn't matter as much as you'd imagine

i am very pleased to say that stormgate is good now instead of just having the potential to be good.


Original review:

More important than ANYTHING ELSE, Frost Giant is [i]actually[/i] connected with the community. This isn't Blizzard or Fatshark or Bungie or any number of other studios that take months to acknowledge obvious issues and put out a mealy-mouthed ""we hear you"", Frost Giant had the guts to speak up [i]two days[/i] after the Founder Early Access to acknowledge that they made mistakes and directly address pain points that the community has been vocal about. There's a spirit of enthusiasm and forward motion that is absent from many developers.

Overall, Stormgate has an extremely promising future. The devs appear to know what they're doing and there's the potential to overtake or even replace Blizzard's RTSes in every way that matters.

[b]As for the game itself:[/b]
- The Campaign is unpolished, but it's also unfinished. Frost Giant has clarified that the Campaign has several placeholder assets (most notably the cutscenes) and better versions are on the way. They [i]should[/i] have said that there were placeholders from the beginning, but lessons were learned.
- The 1v1 is crisp and fun to watch.
- The Co-op is fun, features cool heroes, interesting twists on core armies, and has far more depth than it initially appears. The Gear system in particular is excellent.
- The Editor is not out yet, but Frost Giant is is enthusiastic about getting it into the community's hands.
- The factions are tightly designed and each has multiple Cool Features™ that set them apart from each other.
- There are some pretty severe audio issues to the point where I would recommend playing with the game muted, but Frost Giant is well aware of these problems and is currently working to address them.",1723118883,2024-08-08 08:08:03

steam,171667784,"This game has such a good technical foundation and strategical depth. I cannot remember enjoying 1vs1 in a RTS that much since SC2. Of course the meta at the highest level is a bit problematic, especially celestials i think, but that shouldn't matter at all at this point (obviously it will change alot in the future). Personally I have so much fun figuring out different builds and strategies. I highly recommend investing some time before making up your mind, it took quite some games until i got really hooked.

However, there are also things I would like to address that I think need more work.
First, the campaign, atmosphere and world building is not there yet. It does not really matter to me since i'm mainly looking for the pvp experience, but i think the majority of players are more interested in the campaign and coop. I recommend those to wait until it is f2p. Second, the graphics...i actually don't mind the style at all but i do think it lacks alot of cohesiveness. Sometimes the units, buildings etc. in combination with the maps don't fit together that well in my opinion and it feels they are thrown together from different games.

All in all, I am really enjoying Stormgate and looking forward to the future of this game.",1723104532,2024-08-08 04:08:52

Keep in mind that this is early access, and the team is very capable of polishing out the shortcomings in this title. so if we as a community do not provide good, constructive criticism, we end up with unpolished games that are pay-to-play. or worse!",1723098621,2024-08-08 02:30:21
steam,171663692,"I don't play these games for the PvP so I can't comment on that.

The campaign is really half baked. Writing is average to bad. Cut scenes feel disjointed like each cut was worked on at a completely different point in time then slapped together to make a scene. Story itself feels very safe and campy, like they're trying to play it safe for a rating or something.

The game itself feels alright, there's nothing new being brought to the table. I think had they not tried to ride on the ""ex Starcraft/Blizzard devs"" trope and just lowkey been viewed as a new dev company the game would be better received. You'd expect pioneers in the industry to have some new ideas after 20 years.

Overall nothing really hits playing the game. It doesn't feel like it's geared towards adults, who make up the bulk of the RTS fan base. I'm pretty cynical about free to play games, but this one definitely has the hallmarks of how free to play games influence decisions that ruin the quality of a game.

Overall it just feels like a reminder of why the RTS genre has failed. There is absolutely nothing new being done in the genre for decades now. Their PR team screwed the pooch hyping this up as something innovative and making implications of Blizzard North quality. Either the people in charge are out of touch, or the developers from Blizzard working on this were not the people that made games like Warcraft and Starcraft amazing.

On a side note as someone who purchased the Collector's Edition, it's a real bitch to see an entire hero at launch that I need to pay for.

If full release cleans things up I'll update my review, but I'm not hopeful. It's really just an average RTS when the genre really needs something fresh.",1723097662,2024-08-08 02:14:22

Coop and 1V1 looks like the current meat of this skeleton while the campaign is developed and made.

I'm having a great time with the game! It feels like I'm learning SC2 again, except this time with awesome Vanguard music that makes me feel nostalgic about Command and Conquer. Every game yields a lesson to be carried into the next game and makes me think about how to handle different situations which is something that I always loved about RTS, particularly SC2. For example, how do I handle the spinny spinny sharp guys that roll around at the speed of sound on the Celestial faction? Maybe if I have enough Exos with the speed upgrade I can win, etc.

It also seems like the people making the game are genuinely passionate about the game that they are making and have generally handled any situations with their community in good faith. For example, as of writing this I hear that they are going to give away the next hero that comes out because some people felt like seeing content in the game at launch that they didn't own after supporting the Kickstarter was a slap in the face.


the rest of this review is just conjecture and I don't know anything, so take the rest with a big grain of salt:

I think it's also good to keep in mind that while a lot of the members of Frost Giant are seasoned in the game development industry, this is the first game that this company has put out and maybe there are a lot of people who are working together for the first time and also potentially their first Early Access game. Maybe there's some ""feeling out"" that needs to be done as far as the level of polish that is acceptable to release to Early Access or how to set expectations. I'm hoping that some of the concerns about the campaign are just because Frost Giant felt comfortable releasing something that is in the earlier stages of development than some other early access games.",1723053583,2024-08-07 13:59:43

You will lose to early aggression if you go on the ladder but a lot of the fun in this game comes from the fact that you're always doing stuff instead of waiting around, and early expanding is still one of the best ways to play the game.",1723053566,2024-08-07 13:59:26

I like the character design (subjective, true) and sleek UI and controls. Units are super-responsive and it's easy to pick up if you have played any RTSes before. Other than that the game needs help with everything from graphics, animations, sound design, bugs in campaign, you name it.

steam,171628274,"Constructive Feedback on Stormgate Post-4.0 Update

Dear Stormgate Development Team,

As a long-time RTS enthusiast with over 1,000 hours in *StarCraft II* and extensive experience in *WarCraft III*, I'd like to share my observations on Stormgate's current state after the impactful 4.0 update. The game is clearly evolving toward its promised vision, demonstrating your team's strong design philosophy. However, several critical areas require refinement to elevate the experience:

1. Audio Design as Priority Optimization
While visual clarity has improved notably, audio feedback remains a key immersion barrier. Units currently lack:
- Distinctive attack/movement signature sounds
- Death vocalizations differentiating unit types/contexts
- Skill activation cues with tactical significance
*StarCraft II*'s masterful audio layering allows players to intuitively assess battlefield states through sound alone. Enhancing Stormgate's audio hierarchy (e.g., making Zergling swarms ""sound wet"" while Colossi footsteps resonate mechanically) could dramatically improve gameplay fluidity. 
We want to hear the scream and roar of massive Vangard bio getting killed, heavy explosion when the shell of a siege tank crushed on the ground, tearing the flesh and steel, and waves of cries and howls from a variety of Inferno creatures, there could even be a very short chant when a Celestial warrior dies along with a soul or energy fleeing out of its body, that must be stunning to hear and greatly shapes the character of SG's massive battle state.

2. Streamlining Mechanic Complexity
The recent instant-worker training adjustment exemplifies excellent simplification. I propose extending this philosophy to:
- Neutral Camps: Remove context-sensitive rewards and implement global passive bonuses (e.g., +5% attack speed per captured camp on all units throughout the map). This preserves map objectives while eliminating micro-intensive ""healing zone"" management.
- Unit Actives: Re-evaluate skill bloat (e.g., Vulcan's Jet Pack). Consider converting situational actives into passive upgrades to lower the micro burden but gain more direct macro battle satisfaction(e.g., ""Rotating Barrels: +30% attack damage and 1 range after 3s continuous fire""). Back to hangar skill of all Vanguard's air unit is also extremely weird to use and mostly work as a bummer while pushing toe wrong button in fierce battle
- Unit passives: Re-evaluate passive upgrades that causes more micro to gain benefit (especially red vulcan's passive upgrade to burn for resource and other similar design that has no instant enhancement but only bring benefit by increasing tons of micro that don't even really feels consistent to player's flow or already against the original unit orientation, red vulcan should act as a core small unit killer instead of a interval-laborer and making player start to consider about the tree distribution on map just for the little extra gain, which is a true flow killer)
- Most on-top skills of all three factions are either unworthy or feeling weird to use: by far only Inferno has a relatively logical and consistent skill pack, but still most of the skills lack instant positive feedback to use or have little connection with the other

3. Cooperative Mode Revisions
Commander Amara's current design issues:
- Overly restrictive ultimate ability and other ability(mostly unusable post-death causing negative feedback loop for new players)
- Disproportionate progression rewards (e.g., 10% attack and health on bio units vs. 10% commander buff)
- Missing persistent progression ( *SC2*'s Mastery system)
Suggested improvements:
- Modular loadouts with 5+ equipment slots for more build and replayability on a single commander
- Transformative upgrades altering ability mechanics including variation of active skills on the top
- Account-wide progression milestones and permanent out-game value enhancement just like SC2

The same on commander Mallock's current design:
- Expanding the blanket feels not intelligent on both temporary use and base expansion for both Inferno commander, it's not fluent nor comfortable to locate the maximum periphery of the previous blanket tumor. the Tier-3 upgrade of blanket coverage feels even more inconsiderate due to all previous blanket tumor have already been set within the old distance, reworking it as enhancing the effect of the blanket would be much more logical and attractive than the current effect
- No number indicator of used corpses for the resurrection skill, making it a bit fuzz to maximize its benefit
- lack of visual and sound feedback for the buff skill, barely noticeable
- too long casting and too more cost for the ultimate skill, causing players so confused to estimate the casting timing that players might don't really even want to use it
- too extreme anti-ground and anti-air unit design: no core anti-air ground unit along with scarce air unit type, unlike Zagara, Mallock's army composition currently just feels way too discordant

Commander Hammer's current design issues:
- Too soft skill feedback of all
- Active healing requires constant casting due to its small value when having a big army, making it a bit unworthy to use, it could be reworked as an enhanced version of medic's constant healing with auto casting and can be cast while moving and attacking
- Jump attack and blade storm cool down way too long and deal no obvious effect, making the hero feels clumsy instead, if they do not get damage lift, at least they should have longer stunning effect or armor reduction effect to coordinate other units
- Low-grade marine's trench ability feels unworthy to use due to its poor range bonus, often out of reach while controlling a troop. If it has more range bonus while trenched, it could probably be satisfying to use as a tiny version of siege tank

- Commander Castile's skill design fells way too conservative on the in-game growth part, the in-game growth should be covered with more value and be unlimited, it's totally fine and actually thrilling to have another Dhakha-like commander experience that makes players want to actively encounter stronger and stronger enemies so as to gain more and more insane in-game growth

-way too much to be mentioned, only some of my biggest impression

4. Map Design Philosophy
Prioritize *SC2*-style ""high-yield expansion"" hotspots over experimental mechanics like airdrop-only expansions. Neutral objectives could be reimagined as:
- Missile car camp turn to pushable payloads (*Overwatch*/*HotS*-style)
- towers or camps triggering unique map event actively by players to deal a global strategy impact
- unique tech upgrade or simply resource deposits
- no island goldmine raising operation difficulty but just high value goldmine on map artery as player's conflict anchor
- Switch trees into other object or simply add destructible big stones or other textures to match map environment variations along with common unit interactions

Closing Thoughts:
Your recent QoL improvements prove the team understands core RTS principles. By doubling down on intuitive feedback loops and reducing ""homework"" calculations (camp ROI, micro-dependent buffs), Stormgate could become the most accessible yet strategically deep RTS of this generation. Thank you for your dedication to evolving this promising title.

a Chinese RTS Veteran & Passionate Supporter",1723049986,2024-08-07 12:59:46

Do me a favor, stop saying you are former members from SC II development team. Compared with SC II, Stormgate looks like the one released decade ago. I could not even find a point you did better than SC II.

Aesthetic style: It makes me highly doubt Frost Giant Studios is working with Sweet Baby INC. On the other words, the aesthetic style can be regarded as something fully guided by Sweet Baby INC.

Unit mechanic: It is disaster for a RTS game, and it is done by FORMER SC II DEVELOPMENT TEAM. 
If there are two paths to reach destination, lets say left and right. left side is a shorter path but with a worker building the structure and blocking the path, right is normal. The whole army will stuck on left side.
When chasing the truck in Co-op, the units slightly faster than the truck will never be able to attack the truck with a single attack command. It will keep repeating the loop about reaching range, trying to attack, and chasing.

Unit design: 
zerg almost has no anti air ability. There is only one ground unit able to attack air unit and fragile as hell. The air unit has 2 dmg per shot. The last air unit requires all tech tree which is not available in mid game. Or maybe you can build scourge and trade them inefficiently.
There is no damage formula. How much damage can I mitigate with 5 armor? I have no idea.

Co-op: 
Expensive commanders: The price is doubled compared to SC II
Tiny experience: starting from level 2, you need at least two games for each level. (on hard difficulty because me and my friend can barely win the game on brutal as 2)
Inactivate player pool: hard to find players, takes too much time to wait
Unbalanced difficulty for solo or duo players: The difficulty is no adjusted so playing with less players will only makes you suffer.

Campaign: Arthas, Uther, Xel'Naga, nothing new and nothing attractive.

Conclusion: Do not waste your energy on it, chill for at least one year then come back to check the quality.",1723047775,2024-08-07 12:22:55

There's been enough time to level every co-op champ to 20, and the campaign doesn't have enough diversity to play through additional times. There's no new content, they haven't added more units.

steam,171618557,"I am blown away by the expectation people put into an early access game, especially when it comes to QOL things. Sure, it would be nice to have a detailed observer and replay mode, polished voicelines for units, map bans etc., but those aren't the things you want to test out going into early access so shortly after the beta.

My review is solely based on the 1v1 ladder, as I don't care for campaigns and such in an RTS, and stormgate does a pretty good job at being a competetive RTS (people complaining about balance really don't get how game development works).

Main points:
- The netcode is very smooth, I haven't encountered a bug, game never crashed on me.
- Although I would like more factions to choose from (which would make balancing waaaay harder btw), the factions are very distinct from one another
- Art is clear, albeit not polished, but games and fights are easily visually managable for the most time
- The PVP is sweaty, as you want it in a RTS

Pros : the game has a good feeling, veteran from SC2 or WC3, even AoE, you will not be lost, everything is intuitive and the devs did a great job with the pace of the game. You now less care about base building and logistics and more about skirmishes. And they also increased a lot the TTK, so now you have plenty of time to micromanage your units. 

Cons : I don't particularly dislike the graphic style, but it still feels weird, not as sharp as were are used to, and the animation are not yet completely on point. But the devs stated that they wanted to enhance a lot on these parts so i'll keep waiting.

steam,171604896,"30 hours in and i can't find anything good about this game despite being a competitive RTS fan. This game tries so hard to be Starcraft so lets compare them. SC2 was been made 14 (FOURTEEN!!!) years ago and its better in every aspect. SC2 has nice graphic (it looks better than Stormgate by a mile), great music, various voicelines for every unit in the game and solid gameplay both in singleplayer and multiplayer.

Stormgate on the other hand looks like a home project students make when they learn Unity: 
Visual? Stormgate looks like a mess of free assets with 5fps animations for units. No style. No aesthetic. Just a plain mess of random assets.
Sounds? What sounds? No good music, no voicelines, no ambient, nothing. 
Gameplay? Singleplayer? Almost nothing in singleplayer or coop. Coop is actually a copy paste of SC2 coop with ZERO new ideas so why play this half-baked shit while u can play SC2 coop if you want it?
Maybe multiplayer? Unbalanced, unpolished. 100 years away of being competitive. No QOL features. No map bans, no start countdown, key rebinding doesn't work (at least for me), no replay overlay, no stats (graphs).
I mean you really don't need a 100 hours of development and two billion dollars to make such simple thing like countdown or detailed aftergame stats in a game you want to be THE NEW COMPETITIVE RTS. Thats a joke.

P.S. I feel like it is the right time to remove EA feature from steam. It really became a legal way of scamming people. Go on with closed or open betas if you really need a player feedback.",1723025003,2024-08-07 06:03:23
steam,171603534,"TLDR: 3/5
- Better than recent RTS's that I've played. Hope early release will help the game get better over the coming years (I expect minimum 2 before it comes up to expectations).
- Leans more towards wc3 feels but with smoother gameplay.

Gameplay 3.5/5
- Smooth, Similar to wc3's but a little faster - much slower than sc2
- Unit handling is somewhat okay but still feels clunky like wc3 but harder to select units.
- Hard to see what units are when in a big battle similar to wc3 with all the different colours and shapes of the units.
- No damage/armor upgrades but plenty of upgrades all in 2 buildings that can be easily accessed by hotkeys and no need to hotkey them individually.
- Hotkeys are tricky to get used to but make it extremely easy to build units and rally them somewhere (army and workers). Same with starting a new building, fantastic having the hotkeys to start a building without selecting a unit.
- I miss the resources in the top right/left of the UI. Having everything compact in at bottom is hard to see glance at when in battle.
- Coop is fun with its different difficulties and heroes very much like sc2 (Big fan)
- Ranked (I'm too chicken to play this)
- Campaign starts off slow but builds up some very fun levels that made me upset when there wasn't anything else to play. (Look forward to more of this!)
- Luminite and Therium are the 2 resource types. These are words i've never heard before so i mix them up all the time. Really prefer these renamed to something like ""Gold and Stone"" 

Audio 2/5
- 90% of the character voice overs saying (building complete) are loud, overkill and annoying
- Music is okay but in my uneducated opinion music for the races don't fit and feel a bit overkill
- While in the game everything is either way too loud or way too quiet. I want to hear the enemies stuff dying and damage being dealt but all i can hear is ""Unit ready"" or sword swiping sounds.

Cutscenes 3/5
- Although i can tell a lot of thought and high talent was put into these they still have a mix between cringe and okay. Visually they look high quality but while watching the characters look quite stiff and awkward like something huge is about to happen but then it just ends. I also have no attachment to the characters or much interest in the world.
- Where's the subtitles? Couldn't find an option and my deaf ears can't understand the grumbles of the infernals.
- Also I don't know why but Amara is uncomfortable to look at but every other character looks stunning.

Story 2/5
- Feels like the game is building up to a huge story and slowly bringing the player into what it could be. But so far haven't felt anything for the characters except for ""Ooh pretty weapon"". Really want more world building here rather than ""I'm Vanguard and you are Infernal so i kill you"".",1723023064,2024-08-07 05:31:04
steam,171602608,"Stormgate is a fun RTS with a lot of potential. The core gameplay is smooth and units are easy to control. The quick macro panel helps a lot especially in stressful situations. Both the Vanguard and Infernals are fun to play and have some cool units. Not so sure about the Celestials yet, but some of the ideas behind the faction are interesting. The audio is a vast improvement from the EA launch, but there are still some holes where it doesn't sound that good. The graphichs and art style looks good to me, I can usually keep track of the different units during fights. It runs fine for me, a couple of frame drops, but no crashes and nothing that lasted long or hindered my play. The campaign has a lot of fun missons to play, though a bit too easy if you have RTS experience. The story is decent, nothing fantastic but keept me going and I am interested in where they take the story next. The dialouge writing is a bit stiff and none of the characters have grabbed me as much as say Kerrigan or Mengsk from SC. The Stormgate mechanich has made the 1v1 versus a lot more exciting and the skirmish challangers are a cool idea that I had fun playing against. I haven't played much of the costum maps, but from what I have seen they are great and the editor has huge potential going forward.
Overall a very fun game to play that could be one of the best RTSs ever if it is alowed to get there. 

EA review:
The base gameplay is really good and fun to play. Moving units and building things is smooth and easy to do. The story seems generic, but decent so far (after mission 6). The mission design in the campaign is great and varied. The biggest problem at this point is the audio. The voice acting is sometimes to flat. The sound effects lack impact and the sound balancing is quite bad. If the audio issues gets fixed I can see this becoming a great RTS on the same level as SC2 (which IMO is the best RTS ever made).",1723021546,2024-08-07 05:05:46

steam,171595547,"I have never written a serious review of a game on steam before, but to show my support, I am now. 

I'm loving Stormgate. Most of my hours are from the 1v1, but I've played the entire campaign released to date and maybe a dozen coop games. 

People make a lot of comparisons to Starcraft, which is valid, but what's not valid is to say the factions are a straight rip off of Terran, Zerg, and Protoss. There are surface level visual similarities, as well as some not-so-unique mechanics, but I have not once found myself wanting to ""just play Starcraft"". These are different games and for me, there will always be a time and place for both.

I had a lot of fun with the campaign gameplay. It took me about 3 hours for the 6 missions on hard difficulty and I didn't restart a single mission. No idea how people are completing the campaign faster. Few bugs here and there, but I personally can overlook them. I'm actually not super keen on the story so far, which actually significantly matters to me, but that being said, it's not done yet (which of course, as the game is in early access, should be obvious).

Which brings me to my last point, there's a lot of complaints I do understand, and so much more that I don't.

Every mode in this game can be tried for FREE (starting Aug 13). It blows my mind that people are up in arms about a game they CHOSE to put money into when they could have waited to try it for free, if they had even any hesitations at all.

Strictly from a multiplayer/co-op perspective (no real interest in the campaign), this game has so many quality of life features that make it hard to go back to other games. The integrated command card does an amazing job at minimizing the amount of clicks needed to do an action, without ""dumbing down"" any core RTS gameplay. This, combined with the slower time to kill makes for highly dynamic and engaging games with many smaller skirmishes as opposed to singular game-ending fights.

It is with a heavy heart that we announce the cessation of development for Stormgate. After four months in Early Access, Frost Giant Studios has worked hard to deliver the best video game experience we can, however Stormgate has failed to live up to our sales expectations.

From the beginning, our goal was to deliver a groundbreaking RTS experience, and we are deeply saddened that we could not fulfill this vision. Despite our best efforts and the incredible support from our community, we have been unable to sustain the development of Stormgate.

We want to extend our sincerest gratitude to all our players, backers, and supporters. Your passion and feedback were invaluable to us. We are profoundly grateful for the journey we shared and the memories created along the way.

steam,171578198,"EDIT after patch 0.4.0:
Lots of improvements, however, this is the state that I thought the game should/would have released in early access, so I'm not at all impressed by this update.
There are still a ton of work ahead of them for a 1.0 release. My level of confidence that they'll be able to deliver an actual 1.0 is very low (polished, balanced, feature complete, etc). I'd love to be proven wrong though.


I really wish for this game to succeed. I was rooting for it more than any other game. However, I can’t really recommend it in its current state for a few reasons:

- After years of early access titles on Steam, I’ve come to expect a certain standard for these types of games. Unfortunately, Stormgate does not meet those standards. The audio and voice lines are terrible, there are placeholders everywhere, etc.

- The campaign is too basic, even though it was announced as one of the main selling points. The voice acting, writing, boss fights, and quest design all feel bland and uninspired. They’ll really have to do a 180 on it if they want a successful 1.0 release (and I really hope they manage to do this!).

- The art style is just not interesting. It’s difficult to put into words what’s lacking, but it feels like a pre-alpha of a tiny indie game made by a few people in their spare time, not an early access game made by industry veterans using UE5. Again, they might improve this later, but I’m reviewing the current version, not a possible future version. Who knows if the company will have enough cash flow to reach their own end goal on polish.

One thing I’d like to mention, though, is that the 1v1 seems really fun to watch, excluding the fact that Celestials seem unbalanced at the moment.
I'll gladly change my review to positive later, if they make improvements.",1722980723,2024-08-06 17:45:23

steam,171577043,"Was highly critical when the game launched into EA. It has gotten much better, the pacing feels better and the units feel a little snappier as well. The graphics overhaul helps a lot, but I wasn't really bothered by it to begin with. It seems like they have more of an idea of the direction they are headed into. 

A few cons, 1v1 games are quick, I've played a lot of sc2 and just kind of play here. My macro in this game is okay, but not perfect, I play SC2 at a mid to high platnium level. I feel because the 1v1 player count is so small there are people who are probably way more skilled than myself and it might be a bit frustrating for newcomers. Since there isn't a huge following there isn't as much content to learn how to play as easily as SC2 or AOE, etc.... 

That being said, its the first time playing the game that it felt ""goodish"" I think there is a lot to improve on, and I plan on sticking around for .4 to see where it goes. I'm optimistic for the first time and give me compliments to FG for sticking with the game in the midst of the darkness. I hope you you guys bring this together! 

I'd recommend to new players to check out, rts veterans or not now. Just be a little more relaxed with the idea of losing before you get a couple of wins under your belt.

steam,171564480,"While I am glad that they decided to give the paid coop commander to people of the ultimate founders edition for free in the next update, I have to condemn the fact that they made such a DLC in the first place (for anyone else to pay) while the basics (pausing, loading, saving) are missing. We are missing features from 20 years ago but already make DLC?! that is absurd. It should come AFTER the game is done or the basics are working, not before. 

By the way, 45 FPS on a 7800X3D and 4090 on a M.2 SSD in Coop on heavy fighting while the game has PHONE GRAPHICS - Hmm time to add 10€ DLC commander! 0 improvement in performance from earlier betas.

I am aware that they are planning to include pausing, loading and saving for singleplayer but this should have been done before EA release and definitely before any DLC.

For the rest:

They only care about the ""pro gamers"" and ""esports"" but not to their actual fans. The game looks incredible outdated equal to some early 2000's phone game with a terrible fortnite style that makes it look very generic. Textures are plain terrible and very low res while hardware demand is high.

Lots of basics are also missing like gestures, mouth movement and such. I can forgive that though its probably planned, unlike the basic features I mentioned above.

Its absolutely MILES behind Warcraft or Starcraft in every way, shape or form. Except for the OST thats like the only positive thing I have to say about the game, however unfitting considering the ugly characters and style.

UI is also really bad for heroes, items got no clear descriptions and you cant see any of the bonus stats you get from items on heroes. Warcraft 3 had a better UI.

I so far see absolutely no reason to just play this instead of either Starcraft or Warcraft (or any older RTS) since it looks like an inferior mobile port of some obscure RTS. They need a massive visual rework as well as redoing the cinematics.

People on their Discord say that loading, saving or pausing ""barely affects anyone so its probably not a priority""...Yeah this is doomed. Who wanted to ever pause, load or save in a singleplayer game or the campaign? Hmm...this is what I mean, its all about the ""esports"" and ""pro players"" and being all big in multiplayer competitive while stuff that keeps a game alive forever like the editor? Comes half a year later. 

Edit about the coop mode:

Out of 6 games in one the enemies turned invulnerable and in the other on Annihilation 2 (almost hardest difficulty) the enemies took 5 minutes longer to send something, so we won pretty quick. 

Biggest issue: The XP gain is so incredible slow and bad, its boring as hell to play and factions are less diverse than in Starcraft. I play literally ABOVE brutal and I get 1/4 XP per match to go from lvl 3 to 4. WHAT THE HELL?! In SC2 I get 1-2 levels unless im like 8! but here? Nope! 

Right now this game is seriously UNPLAYABLE. Campaign sucks, its uninspiring and boring as well as looking silly while no pause/save means I wont play. Coop is sometimes buggy but so incredible dull by progression or variety. On top of that you got terrible looking phone graphics, I can play the Warcraft 3 Mod Assault the Throne and got a better looking game with more content.

I literally cant even see there is any potential or that any foundation is right cause NOTHING is right about this game - 45 FPS in coop towards the end when 3 people engage in combat?! On a 4090/7800X3D?! This game is DOA to me unless they literally rework the entire game from the ground up.

I get it that in EA some things are missing but this has been the worst disaster I have ever played in 20 years of gaming, far worse than anything Electronic Arts or others could push out. It looks terrible, it runs terrible, the story cant be taken serious and the artstyle is entirely unfitting. Singleplayer is unplayable cause no basics and Coop is utterly boring.

Its perfectly okay if there are some bugs or not that much content but this is equal to forgetting the options menu but still going on to make DLC.

steam,171564434,"TLDR: This game is early, if you want to just play the campaign, then i'd wait. As for multiplayer the game feels very solid, and very much worth playing.

I played quite a bit in the earlier versions of this game as well.

Pros:
Great Unit control, the engine feels solid
The race design is very interesting, one race Celestials is the most unique race i've seen in any RTS i've played.
The game performs well on my computer, no lagging or issues running it.

Cons:
Unit visibility is still off, its so much better than before, but in a battle its very hard to know whats actually happening. This is bound to happen in any large battle, and even SC2 struggles with this in large skirmishes. But in stormgate its definitely worse.
The campaign should probably not have been released yet, which is unfortunate because this would probably be the most played part for new players.
All the nice to haves are missing, replays are very basic with no way to see what units a player has, the UI feels unfinished, the after match screen shows barely any information, and the sound feels downright unfinished at times. Some sounds are louder than others, while others seem more like a bug or placeholder.

That being said; I think right now early access is for people like me, who have watched the interviews, the roadmaps, the plan of development. Or if you enjoy the 1v1/co-op mode & RTS. Since if you're a big RTS nerd you'll feel and see some attention to detail in some very ""small"" stuff that just gives goosebumps. For sure they have some very smart and attentive people working on this. Willing to experiment and learn how to make this the best it can be. Actively looking for feedback and cooperation from the community. 

But the work still laying ahead is plentiful, and I'd recommend others to wait for the 3v3 mode to be included as well as some more co-op maps.

The 3p coop just isnt as fun as sc2's 2p coop, sadly, was worth a try but they were told early that it didn't feel great and stuck with it.
The hybrid wc3/sc2 style may work for some but for me, as a long time fan and player of both, the middle ground just doesn't work, It needed to be one or the other.
Tldr, they were told by just about everyone from the start that they were making mistakes but stubbornly stuck with the direction, now they have an unpolished, ugly mobile looking cartoon that is monetised to the hilt with content that is years from being ready.

I hope that they can turn it around but I think that at this point, there is almost no chance.",1722950203,2024-08-06 09:16:43

The RTS gameplay isn't bad, per se, but there is a lifeless quality to it all that makes everything you do feel so.... meh.

There is potential and it could be good one day but this is clearly a work in progress that was released too early because the devs are (likely) mismanaging the game dev process and need to release too early to get this out.  Its a game I'll play again in 2 years and hope its much improved or it won't exist anymore.",1722949421,2024-08-06 09:03:41

So... they've released this ""new campaign"" that as a kickstarter supporter you have to pay for?  Fantastic.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I really hope I'm missing something here.  But after paying and supporting the kickstarter in order to keep playing the campaign I need to buy them?!  Also, I am required to now pay for heroes if I want to use them in a game?  This company really is the offspring of Blizzard.  There is little to no substance or reason to play this game.  It has no business being outside of alpha.  The fact that one of the first things they add in this game is buying heroes to play in unfinished game-modes.  There is no reason to lock ANYTHING behind a paywall at this point in development.  I cannot wait for a studio to come by and make a new RTS...  But this is not it.",1722946652,2024-08-06 08:17:32

On the same machine where you will have perfect performance in games like StarCraft 2 and Warcraft 3: Reforged (which are literally years ahead of Stormgate in terms of graphics), Stormgate will give you <60 FPS on minimum video settings.

steam,171539955,"raw and unpolished in its current state, feels more like a proof-of-concept rather than finished product

graphics are pretty basic yet the game manages to cause significant load to a high-end rig, optimization is horrible. can't say I like the art style, it looks way too cartoonish to me, I just can't take anything seriously because of that.

campaign and co-op missions are disappointing to say the least, can't get rid of the feeling that this campaign exists just because there *needs* to be a campaign in a RTS game.
you have to go through in-game codex to get all the missing plot and lore points and understand wth is happening. normally that's okay but it doesn't help to love this world and its characters.
also you have to buy ultimate edition to play a campaign, otherwise some (all) chapters are locked, but that is kinda expected with a F2P title.
also you have to pay extra even with ultimate edition because, surprise, co-op campaign heroes are not free; devs mentioned that there will be more content given out to ultimate edition supporters, something something free co-op heroes, but I hope at least full single player campaign will be available to supportes when it comes out.

there are improvements since beta here and there, but they are minor and QoL mostly.

also — easy anticheat. we say no to easy anticheat. rootkit anticheat engines are malware and should be considered as an anti-consumer practice. period.

comparing this to SC2 or WC3 in a good way is basically a crime. don't do that or i'm calling the police.
I can see the insipiration coming from these titles, but their ideas are either implemented poorly or underdeveloped.

don't waste your money, at least not yet, maybe it will be worth the ultimate edition price tag in like 2-3 years if the development process continues further, but definitely not today

It will take you a good 50 games to learn a race and how to react to stuff. the faster your multitasking the better. each game is less of a choice like SC2 (do i macro or micro rn, and your income can skyrocket in sc2 during a 10 second window you're forced to micro or choose to micro) . 

in stormgate, income doesn't come in as fast, so you have less pressure to macro for 1.5 seconds during a moment where you're kiting with army or trying to surround. so far i am like 30W and 25L and started playing this past weekend.

-Campaign is boring as hell, characters look bland and are not relatable at all. Free fanmade mod campaigns are 100% better just search ""Chronicles of the Second War"", thank me later. 
Not even a pause or save option and always online?? Already charging $10 to unlock more missions?.
If yall thought OW2 pve missions were bad and half baked, oh boy, you are in for a treat.
-1v1 Matches have even a highest learning curve than SC2 and their focus was to capture more audience, how?. Just in your first couple of games or you stomp with whatever cheese build you searched or you get insta clapped with the most frustrating cheeses ever 'maybe skill issue on my end' Dropped the first couple of games.
No 2v2, no 3v3, no 4v4.
Tastless Tournament was a borefest, if not for the casters, bugs and players, that imo, are top tier legendary people in the RTS esports scene.
No build and tech tree menu? just a random PDF document in their discord?, 42 million dollar game btw.
-CO-OP is half assed. Heroes animations are lame weird and already cost $10 each in the shop?.
-Artstyle is terrible everything looks and feels souless like fortnite/valorant copycat with a fisherprice, play-doh coat of paint.
-UI is bad and not appealing at all.
-No custom campaign maps, No map editor.
-Already ingame shop.

Stormgate is back on the right path for developing the title and making the characters interesting. They removed the copy/paste WC3 style story and swapped a majority of Cinematics. Map design for the campaign missions has improved vastly, but still requires some changes to fit the style/theme of the Vanguard, but that is a personal opinion.

New models look, and feel significantly better than the original Art style and I applaud the shift and acknowledgement that people had issues with the first Infernal art style. 
Campaign Chapters 0 and 1 are reasonable starts to the story, and provide flavor for the universe than I am glad to see, but I do hope they add some depth or additional objectives to the existing missions as they are very easily completable in a short amount of time for the average player.. Arguably <2 hours of content as is for the missions that exist which is rough considering they intend to monetize that content in the future.

I'll be even more excited when the updates come to co-op gameplay but for now, it's definitely improved.
Arguably went from a 3/10 in my book to a 7/10 for this update.

Vanguard and infernal are just.. bland and generic in design and lackluster in graphical implementation. 

Theyre way less interesting than Terran and Zerg. Way less interesting. 
Everything almost feels like  mobile game level in terms of quality. And the cutscenes dont even come close in terms of visual fidelity and epicness of even decade+ old starcraft 2 release cinematics. It just doesnt get me excited to play as OR against any of them as old race trailers of SC2 did.

steam,171520650,"Going In I knew this would feel like an early access game so to preface this review with that if you don't like unfinished games this isn't for you!

Pros:
Gameplay is solid, it is fun and overall fast
Coop - 3 players, multiple difficulties, with lots of replay-ability 
PvP is extremely enjoyable even in skrimish
Graphically I don't think it's that bad like some have said, it's really personal preference but I think the stylized look is good, could use some polish but not hating it so far
Units all feel really interesting to play around with

Mid:
Campaign being broken up into 3 mission packs I'm not a fan of, I think it breaks the pacing up too much especially when the campaign is not anywhere near finished
Micro-transactions on the game at this point - I understand they want to fund the game but this early access launch should of skipped the cash shop until it was more polished, Putting it in mid because it isn't a break for me but may be for others

Bad:
The campaigns writing is not good and cutscenes feel thrown together last minute
PvP may be fun but it is a sweat fest and you'll face people crazy good so it makes it hard for me to say jump into the PVP unless you are doing vs AI


Overall I'd say it's like a 7/10 and that SC2 is the better game to go play and to check on this game every now and again to provide feedback on changes you like and don't like.

steam,171520522,"I am a ranked 1v1 focused RTS player, having spent about 10 years with SC2, and 3 with AoE4. I like campaigns, but have no time anymore (I'm old). I like Coop, but don't find it as enticing because it's PvE. SO, this review will focus exclusively on the 1v1 experience of SG thus far (Aug 5, 2024).

I love this game. I'm playing Vanguard, and it reminds me of the macro ramp up and pace of Broodwar, with unit feel and time to kill reminiscent of WarCraft 3. That alone is a fantastic combination. The engine is extremely responsive. I'd put it at number 2 in any RTS I've ever played, after SC2 of course. That this game beats out AoE4 in early release in terms of that, is unreal. The sheer pleasure of giving commands to my units and ""playing"" with them in a competitive match keeps me counting down the hours till I can play again. Now, as of today, the balance is very much a thing in progress. The T3 units aren't all there. Maps are... not my favourite coming from AoE4 most recently where open land maps provide endless tactical movement opportunities. But, even in spite of all that, the game just feels so nice to play that I can't help but love it already. As the map editor gets released, as the factions become fully fleshed out, as balance gets settled and the meta starts to coalesce around how to survive the various early attacks you may encounter today, I can't imagine how this could get worse. Given that this game is already competing with AoE4 (I'd say SC2, but I left that game with love in my heart a few years back) for my RTS attention, I can't wait to see what's next.",1722907731,2024-08-05 21:28:51
steam,171519864,"Disclaimer: I only play 1v1 and have no interest in campaign or co-op.

You notice how most of the negative reviews have less than 3 hours played, but if you filter to 10+ hours played it's ""very positive""?
Brainlets are comparing a beta test with unfinished models/sounds/cutscenes to a genre-defining product that was in active development for 20 years with a 10x bigger budget.

""THIS ISN'T AS POLISHED AS SC2!!!11""
No sh!t - and that's a pretty huge skill issue on your part if you thought it would be.

Yeah the first impression is pretty rough and I'm not a fan of the artstyle either, but the more you play, the better it gets. It all feels like a mash of mediocre something at first, but when you actually get to learn your units and the game flow of your race, you find a really comfy and interesting competitive experience.

Game speed leans more towards Broodwar pace, which I really like. You actually have time to make impactful decisions in fights and there is a lot of room for micro. You will always have time to react with something if your army gets ambushed - unlike SC2, where your entire army gets vaporized instantly for being three pixels out of position.

Talking about balance here is useless, since nobody actually knows what is optimal or how to counter anything yet. Stuff will get nerfed and buffed, but what's actually important is that you can see how good the foundation is for the game.
Strategical positioning, army comp, beating better armies because you out-micro them, greedy and cheesy openers, it's all here.

My major complaint is probably about the sound design. I'm not sure just how many of the sounds are work in progress, but the general choice to go for a soft and muted soundscape is not a good direction in my opinion.

Funnily enough, cutscenes in Blizzard games have always suffered from this, while games like Elite: Dangerous and even Dota 2 are masterful examples of satisfying sound design in almost everything you do in-game.

When I think about playing Elite, I think about how amazing everything sounds like.
When I think about Dota, I think about how satisfying it is to get a last hit on a creep.

Satisfying sound design = dopamine. Probably 80% of why I even play Dota is because I think about how satisfying last hits are and that drives me to boot it up.

Right now the soundscape in Stormgate is very soft and doesn't invoke any feelings of satisfaction when something happens. Devs have said that sounds are placeholders, but I'm worried about the general vision for the sound design being like this. I wholeheartedly believe that satisfying sound design will keep players coming back, and right now the sounds are anything but.

Also ROLLBACK NETCODE IN AN RTS GAME??? Maybe NA players will actually get good now.

This game is an excellent example of why you should always filter Steam reviews by hours played and look for people who ACTUALLY PLAYED THE GAME, instead of just giving up immediately and complaining.

The game is in a very early state and ranked is mostly cheese, but I'm having a lot of fun learning my race and experimenting.

If you expected this to be StarCraft, maybe you should just go play StarCraft?

PS: Go take a look what SC2 was like when it was in closed beta. That sh!t was horrible - and a way better comparison to SG right now.",1722906736,2024-08-05 21:12:16

steam,171511398,"TL;DR
The game has a very stable foundation. There is some new functionality which is great for competitive play and also features to help new players. I think the game has a lot of potential and will be excited to see the release of it.

I've had a lot of fun in this game already. All the makings of a good RTS is already in place: good netcode, unit pathing, ladder, etc. Now I only really play competitive 1v1s but there's plenty of strategies and tactics, granted the early access has some overpowered builds but I think they're likely to be patched. Once all the units, tech and more refinements etc are in place I think this has potential to become a truly great competitive RTS.

The team obviously play the genre themselves and there are some small but important details for competitive players which I have not seen much in other games. Mainly the quick macro panel. It helps with building, training units and upgrading. For example in the early game you might want to send a worker to start a building at exactly 100 resources, but later on you can simply hit quick macro, throw down the building blueprints, and workers will automatically move to build them. Similarly the unit training and upgrade tabs are basically hotkeys for all production/upgrade buildings and they're added automatically. This also frees up hotkeys for your army.

Then there's the auto hotkey feature which is pretty neat. You can have units automatically added to hotkey groups so there's no need to find them and add them to existing hotkey groups. You can also take any units and steal them to other groups should you want to harass or scout with them separately as in other games. In other words you can use this functionality instead of any select-all-army buttons which would mess up your multi tasking commands.

Lastly there's the Buddy Bot to help beginners macro. It cannot be used in 1v1s but it's great that the game is made more accessible to players new to the genre. Casual players are the lifeblood of any game.",1722894013,2024-08-05 17:40:13
steam,171511108,"Loving what I'm seeing so far. They clearly have the important aspects of the game nailed down.

steam,171510702,"Patch 0.4 seems like a good turning point. Campaign & Graphics are greatly upgraded from what they once were. The speed of the game is also faster.

Edit: Several patches later still no new T3 units & 1on1 gameplay has gone worse.",1722893092,2024-08-05 17:24:52
steam,171509817,"I would like to preface the review by stating that I played this game for the campaign and coop commanders modes.

I wish there was a neutral option for reviews. The game has made significant progress since it launched into early access, but it is still leaves a lot to be desired. This wouldn't be an issue if the game stayed early access, but they insist this is a 1.0 launch, so I am going to judge it as such. (Actually the devs wanted to do away with the numbered system to dodge this issue, but I do not accept their reasoning on this).

The fog of war is still incredibly annoying, it is slow to reveal the map once you start exploring and the revealed areas are so small you often wonder if you are actually revealing anything. I am not sure why this is, Starcraft and Warcraft have already done it perfectly, there was no reason why the couldn't have copied this system, since they copied so many others.

Music and sounds are still poorly mixed, sometimes the game fails to load in music or unit sounds in general, the whole sound system needs work as far as I can tell.

There is no save system in the campaign, only checkpoints. This is unacceptable in a campaign, feels like I'm playing a multiplayer match when I'm playing campaign missions. But then again the whole campaign feels like it runs on some scuffed multiplayer client since the game kicks you out of single player missions if your internet connection is experiencing difficulties.

They also tried copying the Hyperion between mission segments, albeit in a terribly designed, player hostile way. They are part of the missions and are unskippable, making multiple playthroughs for the purpose of achievement hunting or replaying missions extremely tedious as you always have to talk to certain characters during the downtime before you can access the mission terminal.

The story has been improved but 12 missions are flat out not enough for the story they are trying to tell. No time for characters to really establish themselves, no time for the world to be properly introduced, and the stakes are being raised too fast. It feels like we are blazing through the story but at the same time nothing interesting really happens. The missions are all over the place with new stuff being introduced for 1 mission only to be killed off or resolved in the same mission. This all makes it hard to get invested in the world and characters.

The writing did improve, but the characters are awfully bland and uninteresting. Noone really stands out. All of them have kinda one-note personalities, but this I think is also a problem of only having 12 missions. I liked the Admiral the most and all she did was give us orders, steal all our carriers and write off Earth as a loss. Based.

The graphics did see the most improvement and I would say they are in a good spot. Nothing too outstanding but compared to the garbage we got back at the EA launch, they are much better.

As for the coop commanders game mode, I will not comment since they are apprently going to overhaul it, so at this point there would be no reason the review something that is going to change.

All in all the game did improve a lot, but calling this a finished product, which is what a game coming out of early access should be, is just disingenuous. I suspect they had to push the game out of early access in order to garner some interest and sales, they probably need the money, seeing how poorly the EA launch went for them. I'm hoping the devs have managed to buy some time to improve the game with this move, because despite all of the issues I would like to see where the game and the world goes. I'm going to be cautiously optimistic and give it a tumbs up, but to be honest I would give it a neutral rating, if there was an option for it. If you are on the fence, I would recommend waiting to get the game. It's not exactly worth it just yet.",1722892021,2024-08-05 17:07:01

Many other people have reviewed the technical or game play issues that are things that very well may change with future development, but I wanted to focus on something that probably won't. The writing.

The writing and story are terrible. It's as if someone took a grab bag of cliches and modern approved tropes and shook them up in a bag and dumped them onto a story board. Nothing makes sense, the dialog is extremely poor, and the characters generally feel out of place. It took me several tries to play even part way through the story because the dialog and plot was just painful, and the farther I went, the worse it got.

Just hand the writing off to random people on a subreddit and let them vote for plot points. It would be more coherent. As of right now, between the underwhelming game play and the writing, I can't recommend this game.",1722881564,2024-08-05 14:12:44

The co-op mode at this point is basically equivalent to a StarCraft 2 arcade/custom map.

My #1 issue with the current state of the game is that you cannot remap individual commands to a specific key. The game currently only offers grid hotkeys. If you remap a key, it will remap every action that appears on that part of the grid. There is no way to map an individual command to a specific key.

steam,171489660,"Since my initial negative review of the game, things have changed drastically. The graphics have improved immensely. Its actually such a good looking game now compared to where we were on those first few early access months. And the co-op (which is my only played mode at this point) is amazing honestly. I cant say much for the pay model. I bought deluxe edition on release, and its been worth it honestly, when SC2 sold those co-op commanders at $22 AUD each, and I managed to get 4 for $50 and some extra like campaign missions, I can say I am happy with that. Each faction plays uniquely. The co-op commanders mix things up for each faction even more, and there is this amazing BUDDYBOT system that essentially allows a bot to help automate duties like building workers for eco, building buildings + supply(pop) buildings as needed, and even auto-train from all the military training buildings, which lets you just move through the co-op mission, What would normally be a long streamlined progression of moving from easy/normal missions to then hard to brutal. Just lets you go straight to Hard and then Brutal after a few levels easily with the buddy bot on. I can kinda multi-task the game and still win without the fear of losing. All in all, this turned out to be an amazing game for the co-op mode, and I hope to see them dive into this more.

steam,171487432,"Disclaimer: I kickstarted the game (Ultimate Pack - 60€) and therefore I'm obviously interested in the game being successful as I like the grander idea behind the game.

So far, I have played all available six campaign missions and I kinda have to agree with the sentiment of while those missions being fun, the cutscenes and dialogue is lackluster. If I were a campaign only guy, I would be disappointed. Still, the campaign had it's moments and I had fun overall, although I had hoped for more on that end. I really hope they will deliver better quality and quantity in the future.

Also I have played around 10 games in competitive 1on1 and beside balance issues here and there I really like the game. The engine is great, gameplay is therefore great and as someone who has played all Blizzard RTS and most of the Age of Empires series I instantly felt home. The biggest strength is by far the competitive side of the game.

steam,171479748,"2024/08/10 edit: Developers recently posted a road-map of sorts in a text form. Discussing and acknowledging the concerns and desires of the player-base. Everything I've mentioned below was addressed. Whether they will fully commit to them or not, will only be seen by the end of the development cycle. But in the meantime, I will change my negative review into a positive one. As the first step towards a good game, is a proper and clear communication between the devs and the players.

2024/08/01 TLDR:  I don't recommend the game, but I recommend players to try it out once (Since it is free to play), and provide as much feedback as possible.
It has potential, but it will require a lot of polishing and very careful stylistic/gameplay changes. I like the gameplay, but it is lacking by comparison to SC2(Starcraft 2). I dislike the cinematic style and graphics, they are extremely rigid and puppet like. Maps look bland and one-tone. Unlike nicely textured, promotional images from kickstarter. (Except for pre-rendered cutstences, those are nicely done.) I dislike microtransactions on day one of EA release, that feels disrespectful.(reason provided below).

I try my best to keep a positive outlook and reasonable expectations, given that the team is an offshoot of Blizzard employees and might need some time to get into 'the swing of things'. That is why my criticism is based on the desire to see the game at the peak of its potential and not bash it into the ground by pushing the new players aside.

Now, being one of the kickstarters that helped fund this game, it feels like it requires a lot more work to be considered a worthwhile investment. The animation is rigid, characters look like clay puppets operated by hand, the style throws itself all over the place. Trying to be like overwatch, starcraft 2, warcraft 3, etc. Resulting in uncanny valley sort of things. Humans look like skinny dwarves. Demons look like reskinned humans. And Celestials are just robots, instead of being angels.

And while all those things are not as important as gameplay and can always be adjusted and fixed with time, it does affect the first impressions. Which is important for the sustainability of any game. Especially so early in the development.
I understand the desire to relive the nostalgic days of games that were the cornerstone of our childhood, but by chasing two rabbits, you'll catch none. 
In my personal opinion, the developers should commit to either a fully cartoon-based style or a much more serious and gritty theme with less abnormal proportions.

The gameplay however, does remind me a bit of warcraft 3. With some heroes being able to pick up items in the campaign, exploring worlds for hidden clues about the lore, and some basic fighting between lancers and demons. Like knights and orks.
I enjoy seeing mechs that shred the light infantry or artillery that collapses a building with a few shots. It feels fairly responsive. Which is good. But it is still nowhere near the level of Starcraf 2. The main issue is that the developers are trying to copy what was immortalized by the old Blizzard team, instead of trying to create something entirely their own. The comparisons will be unavoidable. No matter how hard they try with this product.

On the topic of microtransactions. I understand that the game is new, still in development and requires additional funding. It is a nightmare for any indie studio and even major corporations at times. But having them implemented on day one of Early Access release? You could've at least waited for the global release for the entire public or even until full release, Instead of plaguing kickstarters with it? When we already paid from 50 to 300 euro/dollars for it. It just feels a tad disrespectful.

Ultimately, despite my criticism and more so my investment. I would like to recommend every player to try it out at least once. Play it in pvp, co-op or campaign or just one of those and provide feedback. Because that is the only way we can help the developers see what truly needs to be changed and/or improved. And if the devs will listen, then we might get ourselves a nice gem of a game.",1722856583,2024-08-05 07:16:23

I would also like to see a ""rapid fire"" feature. Without it, it is very unusual and unpleasant to play. Additionally, please make it so that when you hold down the order key, units are ordered in a queue rather than having to click 100 times.

Very strong mechanics and engine. Very low originality and charm.
This means the game is good for what it is, especially PvP, but don't expect more than a faded copy of WC3 or SC2 for campaign, which invalidates the price point for the missions.
I don't think that's easy to fix before full release, but I still hold out hope that the developers become more daring and lean into their style instead of being bland. [EDIT:] if you read the dev logs, they are really responsive to feedback and that is a huge plus to me.",1722849446,2024-08-05 05:17:26
steam,171475040,"Overall, I can't say that the game is unplayable or bad. The main issue lies in the false expectations set by the creators. I first played this game in December 2023, and to be honest, I liked it. However, in almost every interview, the creators claimed that this RTS would be a ""Starcraft 2 killer"" and would literally change the entire understanding of the concept of RTS games.

After all these promises, what do we get? There's almost no content except for a short campaign with no proper story mode, which is disappointing. You have to purchase heroes in the co-op mode separately. The graphics, well, they could have been better, but they're acceptable to some extent. The PvP mode is okay for now, but for this game to become a solid RTS title, it has a long way to go.

Given the current lack of options for RTS fans, this game has the potential to replace older RTS games and become a good online game.",1722848899,2024-08-05 05:08:19
steam,171474354,"Fun 1v1. Needs a patch but so does any rts launch.
If you're playing for co-op or campaign then wait until actual launch.",1722847819,2024-08-05 04:50:19
steam,171472175,"If you're new to RTS genre and you're mostly interested in having fun, I'll just say this.

Play Warcraft 3(classic version and not that refunded one, just pirate it) and Starcraft 2 instead. Stormgate is doing the same thing like them but worse. Art style, game design are all just really blend and not great, there is nothin original about this. The game barely tries to do it's own thing, it just makes what was already done much better earlier. The campaign is lackluster, it tries to be more of Warcraft-styled campaign, but it barely understands what made WC3 campaign so good. The only way you can continue the campaign is to buy chapters of it like Nova Covert Ops.


Co-op is just Starcraft 2, except it's 3 players and it's not that exciting to play as characters you barely know even after playing the campaign(which was one of the major things which made SC2 Co-op a huge success). Also you can only play fully as one commander(unlike Starcraft 2 where you had at least 1 free commander for each race), other commanders need to be bought for 10$(which is twice the price it was for SC2 commanders).

If you really want to try the game, just wait for 13th August instead, do not buy early access packs.

15th August EDIT: Some Stormgate fan was so angry about my review, that he report bombed it and Steam banned it lol.",1722843902,2024-08-05 03:45:02
steam,171471764,"EDIT @20h

Unfortunately, after 20+ hours of Play I still can't recommend this game.  The campaign is mind-numbing and despite being 6 or so missions in the lack of actual RTS is acute.  Thus far, at least half the missions have been solo with the hero or with the hero and one small squad.  Where the hell is the RTS in this RTS game??

And the problems with Multiplayer continue to feel like sand paper.  The amount of AFKers and leavers is insane and the game has no mechanic to deal with either situation.  At the very least giving a Kick option as well as letting the builder bot take over.  It is better than nothing, which is what you get in so many games.  I think there's a handful of times where all three players have joined in and stayed till the end.

I can't imagine none of this came out during the alpha.  Why these fundamental problems all RTS games suffer from were not thought about by a team as experienced as this development team.

I like it just enough to give it some more time, at least for co-op, which, unfortunately, seems like it will have very little longevity considering how few levels there are for each hero and how few hero characters there are.  It won't take long to max them out.  I have one maxed and another half way to max already, with fairly casual playing over the last 3 weeks. 

But I am not venturing back into the boring and predictable, Single Player.  If I wanted to play a slow isometric Sci-fi game, there are better.

ORIGINAL:
I am a bit torn.  The ramp up in Single Player is incredibly slow and, unfortunately, the Co-op is a mixed bag, at best so, at least for purposes of Early Access I say ""Wait"".

From a technical perspective things seem solid, graphics and sound and have all the options you want, though I would have like to seen more animations for both the 3D talking heads and the units as they fight.  The UI is what you'd expect.  Matchmaking is good and fast but AFKers have been a big problem.

The game doesn't allow you to kick and, while you can start with just you and a friend (or even just yourself!) there's no proper scaling.  When just me and my friend disabled matchmaking it seemed just as difficult with 2 as with 3, though the experience gain was also quite good comparatively speaking.

So we have grief-able multiplayer, awful mission design in at least the first 3 missions, and a model which relies on an RTS releasing maps, modes, and champions in a good enough cadence to support free-to-play.

Do things get better over time but the missions need to be fun to encourage people to actually play further than the first mission.  This sort of slow build up is going to kill that enthusiasm for people to be interested in paying any additional money.

I've seen a lot of stuff recycled from StarCraft 2, mission wise.  Even one line ""In the rear with the gear!"" is straight from StarCraft 2.  

I am not sure there's enough meat on these bones to keep players interested long term and the slow-as-molasses campaign start will turn off a lot of people.

Also, never use Buddy Bot.  That thing wastes resources and has no concept of a decent build order.",1722843136,2024-08-05 03:32:16

steam,171459796,"This is a hard one to review because currently the 1v1 PvP is new and it's always fun the play an rts during the early days when no one really knows what the best strategies are. The 3 factions all feel very different and have cool mechanics to play around with so if you like multiplayer and don't mind grinding out the ladder then it's a pretty great game.

The other modes currently available at the time of this review are Co-op (3 players vs AI in a mission setting) and the Campaign. The Co-op is ok and if you enjoyed that from Starcraft 2 then you will probably enjoy this as well. It's f2p and you can try out different commander characters before you buy them so that fine not my favorite thing to play but lots of people I know enjoy it.

The real problem for me is the Campaign in it's current state is well just not good. Form the cinematics, the characters, level design it's all lack luster or just plain.....kinda bad atm. Alot of people say it's Early access what did you expect but for me in my mind an EA campaign pack is going to come out 80% complete and somewhat graphically pleasing especially if you are asking people to pay for the content. If you can't deliver on that front then it's not ready even for any stage of release. You can play the first 3 missions for free and see for yourself the current quality but as is I would not pay for additional content until some serious work is done.

I would like to leave a positive review because I like alot about the game but since most people are not 1v1 tryhards like me I give this a wait and see for now and hopefully they turn the game into something really great for player of all the modes.

The game will be worked on, things polished, made better, added. At time of review i can't wait to play co-op with friends. And just play more in general. Eager to see where it goes from here.

Edit: 8/13/2024

I have to change my review to negative. Being greeted today by 5 heros in co-op, and then only 1 of them is fully unlocked to play, nah, negative. 

Even SC2 had 3 chars for co-op to start off. One for each race. Not doing so is the straw that breaks the camels back. And worse yet, you've already said you won't do retroactive hand outs because people paid for these, meaning i won't. 

Like seriously, i want to root for you guys, but failing such a basic thing on EA launch is really painful to see. I can't recommend my friends to come with me to this until theres at least one freebie for each of them to play with me. That means 3.

Co-op is also good i found i like it alot more then i thought i would, it includes heroes and is a unique style of play. Campaign is the weakest point rn but its not bad imho just needs work. Considering this is EA the game is in a good state and can really only improve, cant wait to see what they do with the 3v3 game mode, i guess it will include heroes on some WC3 vibes. Custom games are alive and people host alot of 2v2 lobbies since there is no 2v2 ladder. Looking forward to what this game has to offer moving forward, RTS needed a game like this to release. DEVS if you see this please keep working hard we need this.

If you purchased the ultimate EA pack you get everything besides 1 co-op hero which upset alot of folks, well im happy to say that the dev team took notice and while they cant just make the newest one free now cause some people did purchase the hero individually and that would cause its own set of issues, the NEXT PAID dlc hero will be given to us (ultimate edition EA purchasers) for free to correct this bad decision.

If it was an indie developer or hadnt received 2 million USD then i imagine people may feel differently and it would be "" very positive "" rating.

Pros :
Responsive and macro/micro balance
Rollback/ Snowplay feels smooth and noticable
Great blend of warcraft 3 and starcraft 2 gameplay and features
Good voice acting and storyline so far, nice cinematic and glad they are in the game
Hero like progression in and out of game, different warlords.
The zerg/chaos style faction is fun to play and pretty creative
New introductions of raids, attacks, cargos to evolve and add to 3v3 co op gameplay. hope more ideas coming!

Cons:
Art style subjective, i dont mind it, however the lack of movement especially the mouth while speaking feels lazy.
Deluxe backer and already there is content unavailable that requires more payment...
Human faction seems bland and too similar to Terran
No Use Map Settings (UMS) games to date, which is was looking the most forward to and with the announcement they wont be stealing the development of the game ( like blizzard has now done with dota )
No 2v2(?)

Frost Giant is an incredibly impressive studio and has all the backing along with talent and abilities to do what they have set out to do. "" the next generation of RTS "" 
At the moment its fun and a good game but i dont know if they have captured that yet. I respect that they are focused on core elements first and will touch up on appearances, more units etc in the future. i think this is the right decision even tho some say the game is lacking content.

I understand its meant to be a 'successor' to Starcraft 2, and many members of the studio came from Blizzard. But this is too... 1-to-1. It's one thing to be inspired by, its another to have equal units. The 'not terrans' even have a female medical infantry unity available around the same time in a match's flow. There's so much stuff that feels sooooo much like 'We have Starcraft 2 at home', rather than their own take on the game. If you REALLY can't even be bothered to have unique units, how completely uninspired are you?

I see many reviews only focusing on areas of the game that need improvement, such as, faction balancing, voice acting, sound balancing, and cut scene animations. These are valid concerns from players who want this game to succeed. As a consumer remember this is an early access game and it will improve overtime. If you consider early access as an ""excuse"", that is disingenuous. Steam and Frost Giant make it clear the game is in early access and this is a way they can have players be an active part of development. The soul and skeleton of this game is good, it just needs to be polished. If you are on the fence about purchasing the game wait until August 13th to try it free.

steam,171447067,"Stormgate's development continues to make great strides in polishing both gameplay elements and graphical improvements. As an RTS it feels great to play and all three races have asymmetrical unique mechanics that are fun and interesting to utilize (especially the Celestials, which feel completely different from any other RTS race I've ever played). 

Having said that, the campaign is in a very early state and I don't think it's worth playing through at the moment, so save your money and just try out the 1v1/custom game modes for free.

The co-op is fun for free for now (you can play each co-op commander for free until level 5). It's definitely nowhere near StarCraft 2's co-op yet, but has the same vibe and progression system. Only buy a commander if you are really loving the co-op.

The main bread and butter of this game (and the part that's fully free) is the 1v1 mode. The developers aren't trying to hide the fact that Stormgate is heavily inspired by Brood War, StarCraft II, WarCraft III, and the C&C franchise, and it definitely succeeds in finding a fun balance of combining various elements of each game. Unit control and hotkeys feel great (but there still isn't a way to fully customize the hotkeys) and add a bit of quality of life improvements to help alleviate some of the usual RTS over-complexities. 

As an early access title it still has a long way to go, but even in its current state, Stormgate's 1v1 (and to a lesser extent, co-op) is a very solid and fun RTS experience that I would absolutely recommend (especially if you're a fan of any of the aforementioned games).

Tldr. Great improvements, hoping this trend continues, can´t wait for more of the campaign to drop.

Campaign is so much better now and i am now really sad i cannot proceed and do more content, looking forward to further content drops.

Game looks way better, while the unit models themselves are too clean for me i can understand the choice, but terrain, background and lighting is amazing, the updated unit models in 0.4 look very good, especially the infernals - here i hope all units get this treatment eventually.

1v1 also feels better now, i like that the units became faster and workers are on a charge system to reduce the pain of slipping with your macro while still not being ideal. Also if you are on a good economy the first harass you fail to defend can be corrected instantly, but from there on out you have to be way more careful for some time.

In its current form, if you enjoy 1v1 ladder, I definitely recommend.
The campaign isn't there yet, but I'm optimistic it will be.
Co-op is pretty fun, but I think needs more levels within each difficulty level.

As someone who spent the vast majority of their time in the Starcraft 2 1v1 ladder, I am overall very pleased with Stormgate's 1v1 so far. Units within factions are interesting and diverse and already I've seen many different builds. The factions themselves are very distinct and asymmetric. Each match is a little different, and I love it. The engine feels really good to play with, units are very responsive. Of course, it's in early access, and there is still polish to be done. As of the time of this review, there are occasional lag spikes that make it unplayable and when a lot of units are onscreen it can slow down, but, as I understand it, those are just the result of not having done all the optimizations necessary yet to make it snappy with large armies. I'm having a blast with the core game play. It doesn't make me want to pull my hair out like in SC2 when my entire army or worker line dies because I moved my camera away for half a second. In its current form, I'm enjoying the ladder at least as much as SC2 ladder, which I've played on and off for many years.

Overall, the campaign almost feels like it was an afterthought, and I would say it needs a fair amount of work and polish before I would recommend it. I think this is understandable given that it is in early access, however, and the missions themselves are fun to play.

Altogether I like the direction this game is going and am very excited for what the future will bring.",1722798546,2024-08-04 15:09:06

steam,171439910,"So far, I've played a bit of the campaign and cannot recommend the game. It seems the creators were unsure whether to create something like WC or SC. As a result, you have basic melee units armed with swords being followed by guys with something like assault rifles! Just imagine that: 'Men, take your swords and charge the machine gun nest over there!' For a Terran-like race, it just looks weird, especially in battles.

The campaign is a disaster. The characters and story are of SBI quality; it would be best to scrap it completely and start over before the final release.

Technically, it’s not much better. The game combines decent graphics in maps and cutscenes with SC2-looking units, which creates odd contrasts.",1722796354,2024-08-04 14:32:34
steam,171439130,"tl;dr Hard pass in its current state. There would need to be significant quality improvements and/or less aggressive monetization for me to recommend the game in the future.

On paper, Stormgate sounds like a great successor to StarCraft 2. SC2-style, highly responsive units are a major point that a lot of other RTSes I've played lack, and it's a major turn off for me due to how many games I've played of SC2. This is what originally drew my attention to Stormgate and other upcoming RTSes like ZeroSpace and Battle Aces.

One of the design goals for Stormgate's multiplayer was to increase the time to kill for units to promote slower fights. This is a good thing in my opinion as slower fights means less opportunities to outright lose a game because you weren't looking at the right place at the right time. It also gives players more opportunities to micro during fights. However, and this is purely subjective, but I feel like Stormgate has gone too far with this, and as a result, fights feel very lackluster.

On its own, I'm already not a fan of the time to kill in Stormgate. The issue is then further compounded by Stormgate's abysmal audio, which lacks the punch that I've come to expect from units in SC2. Compare the audio from an Exo in Stormgate to a Marine or Marauder in SC2, an Atlas to a Siege Tank, or an Argent to a Stalker or Immortal. Both the audio and damage dealt by units in Starcraft 2 reflect the unit's power, whereas Stormgate units and audio evoke the imagery of hitting your opponent with a wet pool noodle.

A major part of Stormgate that I've been looking forward to has been the co-op mode. I've spent a ton of time playing SC2's co-op mode, and I was excited to see how Stormgate would take the formula SC2 established and build upon it. Sadly, the co-op mode in Stormgate is just as lackluster as the rest of Stormgate. I've played or seen gameplay of 4-5 or the 6 total co-op maps, and none of them are worth playing over SC2 co-op. All of the maps I've seen have been straight rip-offs of SC2's co-op missions and the only ""innovation"" that Stormgate brings is changing the mode from being 2vE to 3vE. And no, I don't consider adding creep camps to the map to be a significant innovation for co-op.

My issues with Stormgate's co-op mode are indicative of the larger issues as a whole. Stormgate is touted as this next-generation RTS made by the talented ex-Blizzard employees that brought genre-defining games like WarCraft 3 and StarCraft 2 to players. And yet, I haven't seen anything that gives me confidence that the team behind Stormgate is capable of creating a next-generation anything.

Stormgate is in early access and the entire game is super rough. This on its own isn't necessarily an issue since every game has to go through rough stages of development, but it *is* an issue when the dev team hasn't shown any reason to believe that they're capable of providing a polished experience *and* they're also charging players for the content via microtransactions (or more accurately, macrotransactions). I would be willing to give the devs far more benefit of the doubt if they showed they were capable of putting out SC2-level quality in one area of the game while leaving the rest of the game in early access levels of quality. But until they've put something out that's at least on-par with SC2, I can only go off of what they've released so far and none of what they've released is worth the pricing they've decided on for the game.

If you want a fun campaign to play, you're better off buying or replaying SC2's campaigns. If you want a fun co-op mode, go play SC2's co-op and enjoy getting two high quality commanders for the price of one unpolished, uninnovative Stormgate commander. And if you want to play 1v1, well, maybe Stormgate is an okay game for you. But I'd rather play SC2 despite its more punishing time to kill than Stormgate with its mediocre gameplay, sluggish time to kill, and poor quality visual and audio design.",1722795508,2024-08-04 14:18:28
steam,171437886,I've thoroughly enjoyed what we have seen so far.

The campaign is a copy/past from WC3, the art/animations for it are janky, and after paying 30$ you still have to buy heroes for co-op.

The main part, pvp or 1v1 is.... not great. There are some wonderful ideas, but essentially you have terran, zerg variant, and cannon rush/proxy protoss only. Imagine a whole race dedicated to proxying. I wanted to play the celestials and have an actual race, but not just proxying.

Not polished, a lot to be desired, and there are many janky features. Not the happiest, wish I could get a refund and forget about this game until it is released fully.

I like the stylized design, but non animated characters during cut scenes rendered in engine, oof, it just doesn't feel very heroic and is immersion breaking.

steam,171425629,"As of now, I've played this game for almost 20 hours. That's not much but enough to realise that the more I play this game the more I enjoy it. It is a Starcraft-type RTS although it shares a few similarities with Warcraft. The game is very responsive and the 1on1 already looks quite good. It is definitely entertaining and has improved substantially since earlier Beta versions.

I am mostly interested in the campaign and the 3v3 PvE or PvP, which are at a very early stage at this time (in fact, there is no 3v3 PvP as of now). If you are only interested in those, it would be better to wait another 6 months at least.

I see so many negative reviews and it is a shame that so many people haven't yet realised that this is an Early Access version of the game and still (very) far from its final shape. This is likely 2 years away from its 1.0 version. You are NOT playing a final version or even something close to a final version. It just does not make any sense to criticise this Early Access version for not being ""Starcraft 3"" or for not being as good as Starcraft 2. Also, based on Steam statistics, I realise that the vast majority of negative reviews are from gamers who played this for just a few hours and decided that the game is ""terrible"". If you only select reviews from gamers who played this for more than 20, 30, 40 (etc etc) hours, you will see that the majority of reviews are positive and I can easily understand this. The game is very promising already.

Having said that, I feel this game needs to improve its art direction and visuals. This is maybe the main source of complaints and I understand why many gamers may be unsatisfied with this.",1722781765,2024-08-04 10:29:25

steam,171419457,"Been following this game's development for a while now. Played it during Steam Next Fest and Early Access, but the new and reworked campaign is only complete with this launch. (I didn't spend 100+ hours just on the campaign :P )

So how does the campaign stack up?

I think it's not as polished as I hoped for; but it's definitely polished enough that I, and I think you, will enjoy playing it.

It's not a super-long campaign, but there's a surprising amount of meat (so to speak) with what's there. You have meta-progression throughout the campaign which makes your playthrough feel a little more personalised.

There's also a lot of optional dialogue inbetween missions that's all fully-voiced. Some might find it a bit much, but for someone who enjoys lore/story, I appreciate that they crammed quite a bit there, and you always have the option to skip through it if you want.

Finally, the levels themselves are pretty nostalgic. Just like with WarCraft 3, they crammed lots of hidden nooks and crannies in the levels where they reward your exploration with items or powerups.  

All this isn't to say that there aren't cons; like I said, the main one is that the polish isn't 100% yet, and there's more work on the factions to be done (for multiplayer). Your mileage may vary; but for me, these don't detract from the campaign experience enough to prevent my enjoyment of it.

I'd say it feels more like a high-effort Double-A offering, than a Triple-A experience, which I don't see as a bad thing. They raised more money than most indies, but still nowhere close to Blizzard budget, so this is in line with what I expected. If you go in with similar expectations, you'll have a good time.",1722775073,2024-08-04 08:37:53
steam,171418269,"After 20+ hours of early access and playing the Beta I think Stormgate fundamentally is a fun game and I believe its going to have a bright future. 

The 1v1 aspect feels very fun and competitive, the more time you sync into the game the more nuances and different styles of playing the same race become apparent.

Not having regions and being able to play people all over the world with minimal in game issues is amazing.

The ladder with split ranks for each race (Including Random) promotes being able to learn and play the other races in ranked without tanking rating this is also great!

The campaign and Co-op mods along with sound design and general aesthetics could use some work, but the game is in early access and I am sure many improvements will come!

Overall the Team have done a really solid job and think we should all take a minute to remember this is 'early access' and even when most games launch they take a little to find there feet. People with less then 10 hours played should not be leaving negative comments on a early access game you have hardly scratched the surface of.

Really feel for the team at frost Giant dealing with this negativity.

I can't really put my finger on it other than they made a game that is soulless - perhaps there is a time sensitive difficulty that comes from the financial responsibilities as it seems that the ex Blizzard guys are trying to maintain their previous paychecks. 

Its like very bland in its current state from the visuals, game play, races. There is just nothing here that makes you want to come back after a game. The game was designed for 1v1 clickfest eSport instead of trying to make it fun or have anything that resembles some creativity.

They didn't seem learn any lessons and still just iterating in the most least risky way on the SC1 1998 everything, which is a much better game unfortunately.

Just go play Supreme Commander, SC2, RA2 etc etc while you wait for one of the other new RTS in case you are new to the genre and skip this for now.",1722770878,2024-08-04 07:27:58

Is a fast paced game with no room for tactics or strategies, really, just build units, engage oponent and try to get the uperhand, reapeat until one of you capitulate.

It sucks and is a disapointment, put heros with abilities and stuff on a strategy game is lame, stupid and non sense. Units with almost no strongs or weaks, come on!?

There is a lot to like about how stormage is shaping up, but there are a few rough edges that may put people off. I think the main thing to know is that the bones are great. The game feels responsive and the small but impactful tweaks to the genera really shine. The command bar allowing you to build units from anywhere, the buddy bot system and auto grouping allows anyone to perform macro tasks easily. I really love this system and going back to starcraft afterwards, i really missed it. There is still a lot of refinement to go though, so I would say, let them cook, and come back in a year or so to see how its going.

Now with that out the way, the game is fun, it's new life to RTS games, can I imagine myself playing this in a years time, I think so but I hope that they add in alot more units, because it's very barebones at the moment.",1722766569,2024-08-04 06:16:09
steam,171412160,"I want to make this clear, this is a very tentative thumbs down, more to educate on what to expect, and my current thoughts on direction.

The actual meat and potatoes, the gameplay, is honestly fantastic. I like the mechanics, while clearly inspired by WC3 and SC1/2, the changes I think are good enough to consider the races to be a new experience. I like that the TTK isn't instant on workers, but I can't take a coffee break during combat and come back to see everyone still alive like in WC3. There is also a lot of room for advanced micro while still being forgiving to newer players. PVP is in a great spot and I think it will only get better.

That's where my real positives end, anyone interested in a full RTS experience should be wary.

I don't care if this is early access, if the campaign, story, and cinematics we currently have are indicative of what is to come I am sorely disappointed in this team. I could care less about ""DEI"" controversies, the characters could be fine if this was written remotely competently.

The setting has amazing potential, humanity on the run after Dr. Betruger from Doom 3 calls Hellspawn unto the earth? Count me the F**k in. However, they've decided to go the cartoon route. Nothing is grim and mature, it's like I'm watching a watered down avengers cartoon with wordplay written from an AI studying r/stories on reddit. The main character is an unbearable loser, father figure died in the invasion and now I'm a dark brooding bad b*tch with awful lines that ignores command because feelings and destiny.

Bad guys are morons, back story hasn't been fleshed out at all, there are no stakes, most of the dialogue is f***ing goofy, and the most interesting character (big old paladin man) gets walked all over while the get it done characters during chapter 1 are all random women showing up out of nowhere while the dudes are apparently all idiots. We can't lose, there is literally no feeling of urgency, feeling outmatched, my heroes are unstoppable until we get to a cutscene, and it feels like humanity is thriving on a different planet and we're just taking earth back with superior weapons and a third of the enemy's manpower.

Missions are barely functional, tons of glitches, barebones maps, which is wild since there is literally NOTHING unique or interesting about these missions. You've seen it all before, they had to barely come up with anything and it's not even competently put together yet. If you guys think it wasn't ready to be shown, and the current version of the story isn't what you're moving forward with, you should have just released the multiplayer for now, and left this in the oven another year. Like actually, delete the campaign and start over, see if the multiplayer pops off and funds your development, then come back to this if you're passionate about making a real successor to Blizzard's masterpieces.

Graphics are honestly fine, visibility is great, I can see what all the buildings and units are (if you can't you're a moron), the only issue I have is the maps are low on ""doodads"", there is very little visual aesthetic to the maps. I'm sure this is done for optimization so competitive matches are smooth and the game is easy to run, but it makes the game feel flat and like no passion was put into immersion. This goes for campaign as well. it isn't visual clutter, make effort to make the game pretty, let people with bad pc's and pros turn their settings down if they can't run it/don't want it. The game looks like top down Fortnite.

If this is seriously early access, like actually making changes and I won't see the exact same shit everyone complained about since day one a year later? Then great, but I'm seeing concerning trends that we've been experiencing with major game publishers for years creeping in, and I feel like this early access experience is a pretty clear picture of what to expect going forward.",1722766088,2024-08-04 06:08:08

The new player experience is a little rough. The campaign feels like a Warcraft III: Frozen Throne, where you're expected to be familiar with the controls already. The coop missions feel slow, and the cinematics in the campaign are rough.

However, if you are looking for a good pvp RTS game, this is it. I haven't enjoyed laddering so much since the peak of Legacy of the Void. The races are unique, in spite of some of the similarities to the Starcraft races. The pace is slowed down from LotV, while not being quite so slow to start as previous SC2 expansions. Since you start with a scout unit, it's a lot easier to be present on the map and gather information. The creep camps also provide good reasons for getting out on the map.",1722749347,2024-08-04 01:29:07

steam,171390693,"I, Skuzzy, am a CIS, white male. It makes perfect sense then that games that tickle that sneering Imperialist gene deep inside (and definitely not-skin-deep) appealed to me greatly at an early age. Why, I remember playing Command & Conquer as a child, building concrete walls to contain my civilian-engineers (in their gaudy, colourful Tshirts) in an encampment, sending them by the thousands to the designated ""cleansing"" ground where my space-satellite ION-cannon would convert them into human torches. I'd laugh at their screams. 

Fastforward twenty-something years and I'm a well adjusted man. I've subjegated various cultures across various games and introduced them to various holocausts of my own design. I've created temples to protect cows, and goats, (never pigs and chickens), I've fried aliens from Mar Sara to Yo Momma. I've played a lot of RTS, I've met a lot of people, and I've probably devised elaborate methods of introducing them to my own special brand of fascist-colonialism.

If StarCraft II and WarCraft III had a child, and that child was Stormgate, I'd send that child to the gas chambers or have someone escort it behind a shed where, in this hypothetical situation, it might be retired with a parabellum-pistole. Like Ol' Yeller who led us to Timmy who got stuck down the well again, it'd be a mercy killing. Unlike Ol'Yeller, it'd be mercy for the world, not the dog.

""But Skuzzy,"" you might say. ""The game's in early access!""
""Don't worry,"" I'd lay a consoling hand on your shoulder. ""I understand that the current balance is going to change. I've been at this for more than twenty years.""
    You might have other protestations. You might tell me Stormgate isn't that sick. But I've seen enough sick RTS games. I've seen when they're terminal, and I know Stormgate is terminally ill. Terminally ill. Terminally re, and terminally tarded. I'd like you to envision a scenario....

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.....Meanwhile, somewhere else, sometime else....


""StarCraft II was a great game..."" sighed Bob, scrolling his phone and lamenting his dead-career.
""Shame we'll never get to work on anything else that great, huh?"" said Jim. Bob cast Jim a sidelong glance. It was all his attention span could manage in 2020. Most of what Jim said went in one ear and out the other. Most of Bob's computing power was focused on reading r/feet. But the final words vommitted out of Jim's mouth yanked him from his reverie and back to reality.

""What if we made our own?""

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And like reality is in so many cases, it was disappointing. The balance can be saved. The fact that the Celestial Armada is dominating the leaderboards could change with some tweaks, maybe the introduction of new (and coming units) to other factions. But there were things that couldn't be saved. 

Let's talk about the visuals.

It's hard to talk about graphics would seeming like some kind of graphic-snob who's afraid of 'cartoony' visuals. I defended Red Alert 3 and I'll defend this game's choice to be cartoony...

What I'm not fine with is the eyeball diarrhea I've been served and Stormgate looks like someone took a deliberate dump on the idea of coherence. At a glance, you really can't tell what the hell the buildings do or what they're supposed to do: it completely fails to achieve what most video games do and it's visual coherance and legibility. This is a pretty big deal considering it's a visual medium. 
             Stormgate is one of the few RTS games I've played where, even knowing that I don't need the hotkeys, I'm confused by the visual design of the buildings. If I wasn't using hotkeys and ignoring the fact the buildings exist entirely, I'd honestly have no idea what the hell I was looking at.  Game designers and Stormgate designers: don't underestimate the value of what the visuals of your game actually convey. The characters are fugly, the units are fugly. It's early access but MAYBE, just MAYBE, these are all placeholders. 
          
The voice-lines are Sword Of The Stars bad, ontop of which the ex-Blizzard employees who apparently worked on this game just directly lifted lines from their previous projects. What they should have lifted was half-decent sound design. I've heard better mixes thrown together from royalty free sound archives. Stormgate sounds as ugly as it looks. Hearing workers spew the same lines as SCV's from StarCraft II doesn't make me think ""wow, remember StarCraft II!"", it makes me wonder why I'd bother playing an awful StarCraft/WC clone when I could just play those games instead. I'm a professional drunk and I could voice-act this game better than anyone they've hired and I could do it for free.

Let's deconstruct language from Stormgate's advertising. ""NEXT GEN RTS"". What's a ""NEXT GEN RTS""? What does ""NEXT GEN"" mean? Next generation -- so this games going to innovate, it's going to do something bold and exciting? It's going to be graphically superior? It's going to tell a story no one has told before, in a way no one has told before? Maybe you'll have branching campaign paths. 

This review is laden with hyperbole but I can't understate this: Stormgate is as visually appealing as Mike Myers dressed up as an obese Scotsman who's just ate Fried-chicken in bed would be as a sexual partner unless you were into some hardcore degradation. Seriously, how do games that are more than 17 years old (Command & Conquer 3, Kane's Wrath, Red Alert 3, hell, STALIN VS MARTAINS)?  Protip: ""next-gen RTS"" and ""looks like a game that came out two decades ago"" do not go well together. It looks on par with 2010 League Of Legends.

There's nothing new here. Period. A lot of the upgrade options are worthless strategically. Caster-units. StarCraft II map-design (ramps but with nothing to block them effectively so certain units just roll in and past your choke points even if there's units, ignore collision etc). I don't like to allude so much to other games when I review stuff but frankly, it's Free-to-Play StarCraft II, but worse in every concievable way when StarCraft II is also F2P (currently). I'm not going back to SC2, don't worry: but my question is why would I want to play a worse version of a game that already exists and still has a larger player base?

As of writing, Stormgate has already lost 75%, down from 4800 players to 1200 in a matter of days. These are the players who paid to play a F2P game.  

I'm going to make a grim 'prediction': the game is dead on arrival. I've seen better games, 'COMPLETE ' games, fail in less time, and I've seen better Early Access Titles (Age Of Darkness: Final Stand) maintain less of it's playerbase closer to release. An early Access release was the dumbest decision this company could have made, and they've done it an a dumb way besides. Monetized to hell. This is a doomed project, and I think Frost Giant knows it. Maybe if Stormgate came out 8 years ago it would've had a chance, but this year, of all years, it has none. Don't worry though folks: Age of Mythology retold comes out in a few months.


Credit due where credit is due, I'll give Stormgate something: the only something. The new hotkey system and global build queue is PHENOMENAL. That's the only innovation here and frankly and it's an innovation that the genre as a whole should be deeply ashamed of not coming up with sooner because the controls of RTS are a massive reason why it loses so many players.

I think Early Access has doomed this game. I think it's in the ""Oh this was a terrible idea, better cash out phase"". I don't see a future here. I'm disappointed. I want my money back.

steam,171385925,"I think there is a lot of misunderstanding and expectations of an Early Access release. Almost as if no one is actually paying attention to that indicator, or the comment below it. This is a way for developers to actually shape a game with user input during development instead of spending all the time to create a game that no one likes. It's a brilliant concept and produces way better results. That being said, things like not having a pause feature right away isn't something you reduce a review for or complain about when it's in Early Access. That's a feature that obviously will come later, but isn't as important as the core mechanics. I'd be concerned if they did focus on those features early on as that shows a lack of experience.

That aside, I have to say I'm really encouraged about the progress. The game plays way better and I actually enjoyed the campaign once I gave into the fact that this isn't going to be StarCraft3. I am really surprised by how much they improved the in-game look and feel within a few months. The inputs are so much more responsive than they were at first. I don't have as many moments were I can't seem to select the unit I'm intending to select. I'm not a fan of the cartoon look and feel, but even that has been toned down.

One thing I want others to see is I believe that the ending of the of chapter 1 of the Vanguard campaign feels quite the opposite to me where it not the end but the start of the beginning of an epic story to be told. Of course everything in the campaign is going to look a little rough around the edge, it is called Early Access for a reason, but they state they are still working on it and I think the work they offer currently with the the depth of gameplay between how unique each faction plays.

steam,171384396,"Dead on arrival, as expected. I played it during the alpha testing and bought it on another account. This game runs worse than a Zerg rush on my 7840HS with 780M, barely hitting 10-25fps.

The GPU is definetly hitting 99% load all the time. For what you get visually this is unacceptable.

The campaign has massive frame drops on story actions, as well as UI overlay bugs and is boring as hell.

The art decision must have been made while everyone at Frost Giant was having a victory toast, dreaming they'd outdo Blizzard. Spoiler alert: they're not even close.

And charging 10€ for a co-op commander on top of the 60€ ultimate edition? That's a bigger betrayal than Arthas at Stratholme. It's a full-on slap in the face.

If you can not understand that this is early access, you will not enjoy the game. Stop reading and go play a different game, this is not for you (yet).
For everyone complaining about paying, wait until August 13th and it'll be free to play. 
There's a legitimate complain about Warz (the first ""paid"" hero), they are instead releasing a new free hero to compensate the complaint is legitimate however that it felt very off putting for the ultimate edition not to include that hero.
Currently the focus is on 3v3s, 1v1s and 3 player coop (which you can play alone or with just one more person.) 

TL;DR: The game is fine, okay, good, people expected excellence from an early access and got salty. 

Now that's over let's get to the review.

I bought this game after very little research outside of a few google searches and wishlisting it from some time ago and keeping up with whatever they put up on steam. I didn't even know they were ex-blizzard folks. Nor does it matter to me. I am not interested in their background, their product is what I care about.

What is wrong? Plenty of things, obvious issues that are a product of the open-beta-early-access version, some pathing, some right clicking on things that are not but are invisible due to stealth mechanics. Being able to place certain buildings in places and the aura it gives out doesn't work properly. These in my opinion, compared to my experience with other early access games, is not a big deal. I've been swindled by companies releasing games I saw as promising.
""Not likeable"" characters, very subjective comment. I myself do not like certain characters but that does not mean the game is bad just because I like X and hate Y.

The laughable critics that say ""oh wait X year/month/day-s after full release"" like they are some sort of tech-warlock with a USB slotted crystal ball shoved into their computer doesn't give me any information, just some weird opinion from someone random on the internet.

The game is not perfect, probably will never be perfect because to misquote a wise slug-creature. ""Perfection changes, you can chase and never catch."" 
For other peoples complains about latency, or lag, or whatever. I have only experienced two crashes. That's it. Once because I fiddled with my audio setup mid-game (which is a bad idea in general) and the other I have no idea.

I have not have any laggy sessions, there are some pathing issues but if you have played any RTS game that's common even for ""finished"" products.

What do I like about Stormgate?

First of all I'm a fan of the commander ""co-op"" setup that Starcraft 2 had, which they have added to this game and it's something I enjoy. 
The ability to quickly just plop a building down using their fancy schmancy ""Quick Macro Panel"", and have a worker just go build it and return to harvest is such a quality of life feature. The ability to then hit one button on they keyboard and be able to look over and produce any unit you can. It's very good, feels intuitive and will probably become a staple in any new RTS, and if not it's a shame. 
Want to select your entire army? Slap that space bar. Done. You can still make control groups and still micromanage your army with ease. 
The factions are interesting but at the moment due to the early-access nature of the game, a bit lacking. 

What I don't like:
Personally didn't enjoy the story or characters. And Amaras picture in the co-op commander screen creeps me out with her owl eyes staring into my soul.
It's lacking in viability, it feels like there's plenty of of units that have such a niche market that it's just not worth it because you could instead mass a cheaper and more efficient unit. This could be personal experience but that's what I feel.

steam,171381194,"First of all: I do not suggest buying EA, but playing it when it is free.
Personally, I do not endorse the SCII monetisation strategy, but it is perfectly understandable.
I am not interested in PvP RTS, so I have not played it at all.
The campaign is kind of fun, but ultra short at the moment. Also price tag of 10$/3 missions is a bit high. I think <=10$/5 would be fine for me if they would be longer and more complex on average. Maybe later ones would be like this. I do not like campaign of SCII, but SG campaign is kind of worse in every aspect. What I have loved in SCII campaign is the between mission progression. So far it is completely missing. That single mechanic concept provides an immersive way of missions being interconnected. Sadly, it is simply not present. For a filler campaign it may be just fine, but it costs money.
COOP feels like a refined version of SCII coop. Progression is somewhat slower (I have only played it solo), but at the same time it means one can play several games on lower levels, which are basically skipped in SCII.
Races and commanders provide more variety than SCII. They work in vastly different ways. For example, celestials race effectively has energy mechanics instead of supplies. When having ""not enough farms"" they have some penalty to things in contrast to not be able to do stuff.
Right now there is way less content than in SCII, which is to be expected from a fresh game compared to something 10+ years old.
Again, my PC, did not suffer from any performance problems. Maybe people on lower end do, I do not know.
I completely do not understand the cries about graphics style. It is a fusion of classic W3 and SCII with some more modern vibes. Exactly what I have expected. Exactly what trailers showed.
What I expect is a great custom map editing capabilities. I am going to invest a lot of my time to ease transition from W3 to SG no matter what would we get. Having minor insights, I just can not imagine how this would be less capable for modding than W3.",1722719529,2024-08-03 17:12:09

steam,171378775,"It seems like everyone is fifty fifty on the state of the game right now, but ultimately this has a lot of potential and what exists is pretty solid. I might be under a misconception but those complaining about the price and having paid chapters later should look into the ultimate edition. Big name titles generally release now for $70, however stormgate base access is $25 and ultimate is $60 with free access to these future chapters upon their releases. This will be free august 13th to play, so if you don't feel justified to pay $25 for this then hold your horses for all of two weeks. In terms of the games state...

Pros
- the core gameplay loop is on par with wc3/sc2, factions are fleshed out and units/mechanics feel unique yet inspired
- unit responsiveness is quick
- unit legibility in game is easy
- game runs very smoothly on highest settings 
- good pool of maps on day one with more promised to come with the existing road map
 
Cons 
- textures lack detail and seem to almost be smudged when viewing units
- story feels half baked, while not bottom of the barrel it needs more buildup to care about characters involved and the setting of storm gate needs to be established more before throwing the player into the fires of a campaign story
- despite having bought the ultimate edition for 60 dollars having a paid hero at day 1 at least seems somewhat unreasonable, for lower editions this would however make sense imo

I think that people should not temper their expectations for this game upon 1.0 release, but understand that this is an ea title and to speak with grace towards the devs. These are people who want to hear your thoughts and make this the best game for everyone involved. The flaws are undeniable, but the more constructive feed back we can give the better this game will be over time. 

TLDR - Foundation is good but needs polishing, day one paid commander despite the purchased edition is an L, but if you are interested and don't want to shill out wait until August 13th and it will be free to give a shot. Ultimately will develop into an awesome game for all, let the developers cook",1722716662,2024-08-03 16:24:22

thing 1: I think the campaign is cooking still (no problem for me).

The graphics are really nice. Only the faces of the characters may not be very appealing because they are so fairy-tale-like. Well, that's the style. However, style is one thing and the quality of graphics is another.

steam,171374252,"It is EA, yes, but there are some fundamental things with the game that we should not have in 2024. I am a Kickstarter backer. This game can be very cool, it has potential, yes it is EA, so read this as a feedback rather than criticism. I have about 3 hours of play time so far, finished the campaign missions (I realized we are missing some levels in between the campaigns? for some mentioned events that we didnt get to play). The game feels familiar which is good, but just too familiar which doesnt let it have its own personality so I wish we can get past that as the game grow. So don't be discouraged by the thumbs down, I will change it as we move forward.

Pros: 
Easy to learn, very similar to just about any RTS after WC/SC
Gameplay is very WC/SC, nothing new so it feels familiar
I like B.O.B

Cons: (Like my grandma used to say, Oi Vei)
Loading: The game takes 2 minutes to load, and I am not sure why.

Art style: Could have been nice back in 2010, maybe. Very cubical, some of it just too simple and undefined. I dislike the part where ingame models are used for the cinematics and how basic their animations are. It just doesnt look that good and not something I expected in 2024.

The game feels very slow. SLOW.


Lore: Please get the lore in the game, not in a video where the director tells me about it. This is not world building, this is a huge miss.

Story: The story feels like it starts in the middle. I have no idea what is going on. I am sent online to read about lore rather than learn about it through gameplay. The story is also very safe and very Hellgate: London/Remnant/nothing we haven't seen before (as far as the EA goes so far). 

Characters: I cant find attachment to any of the characters. I really don't care much for them, especially, and unfortunately, Amara - the main character we are playing. She is just not cool, not a bad ass, just meh and feels a bit toxic at points and not the sharpest in the tool, very self centered - your dad died, we think, doesnt mean you have to act that way. Everyone lost someone, chill. the only cool character is the bad guy you get to see in some cutscenes killing some people with fire beams, and even then, I forgot his name so /shrugs

The game's store: What? A store? Really? ON EA? Even to people who dropped $100 or more and got the ultimate backer kit? I understand exploring that route when the game is published, for sure, go ahead, but in EA? Pfft, come on.

No unique personality: I think the game is trying really hard to be Star Craft, and unfortunately it is not. It feels like Warcraft and Starcraft had a baby and that baby was kidnapped on the night it was born and grew up in a bad environment and is now coming out to seek revenge, but it has no unique personality - there is nothing very new here, and if at all, I reinstalled Starcraft 2 after playing this for about 3 hours.

Pathing:  God and all that is holy, help me! The pathing in Stormgate is so bad, it was the last thing I even thought about getting to play it, but the first thing I have noticed already within the first 5 minutes of the game. Units will try to do some weird things, walking around, walking in circles, run back, and sometimes just stand still and watch the scenery. Please, fix that, I beg you, I don't know what to do with myself.

Pausing game: Can's pause the game on single player. Why not?

Saving game: I have no idea whats going on with the saving, I think its broken. Feels like it is saving in intervals, and I dont think you can save in mid mission.

Play modes: It is 2024 and we need a ""Solo"" tab instead of the headache of ""Custome Game"".

Tutorial: No ingame tutorial. Actually, the way that Stormgate works, and that is with every question you might have, is basically ""Here is a button that will take you out of the game to watch a video or read about how to do this or that"".
Can we not, please? pretty please? There are some cool things in the game, I just wish I could figure them out by playing it through the game and not by finding out about it because I have to break my head to learn how to play it. Also, stop sending me outside of your game when I want to figure out how the hell those Celestials expand their base.

Thats about it. I hope it gets better. So the thumbs down is more of a ""Please fix this"" rather than ""This game sucks"". Hope to see this grow and reach its potential.",1722711561,2024-08-03 14:59:21

I am pleased to report that Stormgate at least meets my expectations, enough to garner a positive review. Let me be clear, the game has a LONG way to go, but the game as it sits today for an early release game, succeeds. 

While others may disagree I respect the focus put on 1vs1 ranked play. I can understand those that want something more out of their RTS than 1vs1 ranked.

The games are quick and each one seems different. There appears to be some balance issues, understandably so but the developers seem to be on top of things. 

I look forward to following this game's progress and why I don't think it will meet up to Starcraft 2s success, can any game really follow in it's footsteps?",1722707337,2024-08-03 13:48:57

But, we talk about early acces titel for already 24 Euro (Germany price) which, ne to to be clear need to stand up agains Stacraft 2 which i can play mostly for free or have a big part of the game when o buy it.

If you play versus / mutiplayer, that seems to be it and you can play. So if this is the only thing 1vs1 rankting you wanna play that i guess the rest of my review is not important for you.

If look beside 1vs1 ranked stuff you notice very fast that a lot of stuff is behind a paywal where you need a dlc or ingame purchaeses. Mind you we talk about early acces....

One exampel is playing koop- you do not even hav all factions with a basic commander, So you need to buy them at some point, cost 9,95 for me. Again, compare it to Stacraft which koop is much more developed i pay half that....

I did not play enough to can say how good gameplay really is, it feels okayisch but i also had a complet screen freeze (Only the game not pc) on my first game. Early acces so i asume that is to be expactet.

The learning curve is really high and I don't think most players that are new this type of genre will enjoy it.

steam,171367190,"Played this game for 11 hours so far so here are my thoughts;

--Campaign

This by far needs the most work out of all the game modes in the game. Story feels bland and lacks animations for all the in-engine cutscenes. Of course, the competitor for this game is also another game built by the leads of this team, Starcraft II, which I would argue has one of the best campaigns in any game across genres. However, it is important not to forget the budget difference between this game and a blizzard IP, so stay fair when experiencing this game mode. I suggest dont opt-in for this game because of its campagin at its current state.

--Co-op

Uses exactly StarcraftII co-op formula, the missions were so far unable to impress me, but the ""Commanders"" were well designed with as much creativity as you would expect in any other competing titles if not more. This game mode has so much potential for the future with some better designed missions and trickier mechanics and more clever ways to deal with them.

--PvP

This is where the game shines. The standard formula of action RTS seems a bit modified to narrow down how factions are ""intended to play"". But it makes up for it with its  incredible mechanical depth, responsiveness and non-linearity when it comes to engagements. Whilst other RTS games felt repetitive after a while, this ones due to its map design and elements in it, have yet to make me feel one match is just like the other. No game feels the same and you actually have to reason your way through way more often than anything else I've experienced. They introduced macro-lighter mechanics to ease macro/micro attention divide to lower the entry bar for new players which I applaud the dev team for. The speed and feel of factions feel right in their own unique way, with some need for balance but its only EARLY ACCESS and yet its already really good. I highly recommend this mode for not just seasoned RTS players but any players across genres to give a try.

--Spectate and Replay system
These two show real promise but dont expect too much flashy tools to play with just yet, this is where the game really shows its developmental phase, but I'm happy with how its going so far.


Overall I give this game a big go for it. In its current stage its rough around the edges so if you're expecting perfection and a fully developed game stay away for now, but it does feel like its the RTS game of the future and by that, I mean not so far away future.

I was a playtester for several months, and put in hours upon hours of in-game time to provide thorough feedback in the discord. I, along with others, provided copious amounts of feedback in the hopes that there would be large changes between playtests. Unfortunately, very few changes were large enough to keep my attention. 

Units are boring (along with the unit interactions), the world building is boring, the campaign is soulless, and, although I don't mind the artstyle, its implementation is quite terrible. Coming from a competitive SC2 (top masters player), I can't see a reason as to why you would play this over starcraft currently, unless you're very bored of starcraft and need to change it up, which is perfectly reasonable. 

The game is to go to its 1.0 release in about a years time. People keep saying, let them cook, they know what they're doing, and I hope they're correct. But, if the amount of things that have changed over the previous 9 months (not very much in terms of overall quality of gameplay) are a sign, then I have a hard time believing the core aspects of the game are going to become significantly better. Pair that with FG being fully funded only until EA launch (Aug 13th), I feel as though the game is not captivating enough for their monetization strategy to be successful for the game to develop to a significant degree, but again, I may be way off the mark.

UPD after 140 hours in game.
It's really sad to write this, but I can’t stay silent.

There’s no game support, the developers don’t listen to players, and they’re making a 3v3 mode—OMG, WHY??? (The game only has 100 people online, who’s going to play 3v3?) And the lags—why does the game lag so much? How can we play if half the maps are unplayable (VETO!!!! We just need a simple map veto, it’s an easy function—why not add a checkbox for it?).

There are no social features (the first social RTS, and yet there isn’t even a chat in the main menu), and the game lags terribly, 20 FPS (minimum, full HD, RTX3060TI—it’s cool)…

I'm a 1v1 player, so here’s my take on that mode (CO-OP is dead; almost nobody plays it, you won’t find a match). Zero changes for four months—they added one new map (which is great, yes), but where’s the veto? Where are the stats? And most importantly, the terrible lags—it’s physically painful to play. When there's a 200v200 battle, you can’t control anything (on some maps, performance is decent, 60 FPS+, which is great, but on most maps, battles drop down to 10-20 FPS).

I’m angry and disappointed. I really like this game—it’s a breath of fresh air with mechanics similar to Blizzard games (I’m not a fan of the Age series, and I envy those players because their developers listen to and support them). But players of SC2, WC3, and now SG just get ignored by the developers.

Thanks to the regular devs and game designers for the concept, but a big disrespect to the management at FrostGiant! I’d say what I think about you, but I’d get banned—this isn’t a Dota chat (but everything they say there is for you).

I played mostly campaign and some 1v1s.

I do like the game and I hope they announce some changes or explain the issues but:
- The campaign story is ridiculously simple, like copy paste of other games(won't spoil but by the second mission I could predict ALL that happened)
- The animations are not good at all, I laughed a lot seeing the NPCs talking, they were just moving their heads around without opening their mouths
- A ton of lag, like 20 unit battles makes the game FREEZE!
- A lot of misspells in tooltips and texts in general that even I, a not english native, could pinpoint instantly.

Overall, all of this is fixable with more time in the oven. Just make sure this is not a Star craft 2 v2... That game is dead for a reason and this is looking a LOOOOOT like it...

Coop Grinding ❌
Solo Leveling ✅

The way the exp work is such a curse, you getting exp based on your team entire kill then split into 3, does not even need to win. Example if you got 400 kill other ally got 100 each, it be 600 total split into 3. You only got 200 worth of exp. Here the fun part, the amount exp you needed for lvl up from 1-5 is double than what you need for 6-11 making you in weakest form for a long time. No matter what difficult you pick the game will drag you on any difficult most ppl queue up atm. You may be level 1 try go for normal difficult, but the MM may drag you to brutal or if you wanted play brutal but game may drag you easy. You will get screw all over trying get for coop game.

Best way to play, just run solo coop game on beginner you will get full exp cap cause you can farm all those exp for yourself.

steam,171356645,"Remember the sound of Siege Engines blowing Zerglings into bits with a single shot?
Remember Banelings dissolving entire Armies of Marines in seconds?
Remember how units were clearly strong for certain things and weak for others?

Stormgate so far seems to have toned everything down to such a neutral level that nothing feels good, nothing actually excels at anything in a glorious manner and therefore no rock paper scissor mechanics actually show. Its all just so bland.

They wanted to make an RTS for people that have never played one and thought ""If everything is good against everything, new players cant make mistakes and will therefore be happier with themselves and the game"". I think that this just makes it so much harder to learn how to play correctly. Units just dont feel nor look a way that intuitively explains their role.

Things have been like this since before the Kickstarter, and it was so bad that I couldnt even jump on the hype train to support the devs with their funding goals, even though imo Warcraft 3 and Starcraft are some of the best games ever created, and definitely the best RTS games. 

I really hope the devs wake up to the current mixed reviews and finally get the courage to just blow things out of proportion, because nobody wants to play a fight game that is just bland. 
We want high risk, high reward situations.
Thats why we had banelings being obliterated by ranged enemies but oh boy, if they made it to their target, they´d get absolutely destroyed in a second! 
Thats why we had Siege Tanks that could easily be overrun or taken out by air, but oh boy would they decimate oblivious infantry trying to get close if one had positioned their tanks correctly.
Instead here we get none of that and just look at units damaging each other with bland audio and bland damage output for sad encounters and sad matches.

Currently finishing the story content and dipping my toes on the coop as a training to start doing some PvP soon as I am quite noob on RTS games even if I have played a lot of them (mostly just the story). I am honestly having a lot of fun.

As on every early access launch buying starter packs is 50% getting value for what you pay and 50% donation. I can see a good base and the speed of improvements is very good. I hope they would have waited a bit more for EA launch as the camaign cutscenes and the enviroment quality is not ready for casual crowd eyes. I will put the readiness of this EA launch above Wayfinders but quite bellow Vrising or No Rest for the Wicked. Which basically means it is scratching to be on the almost guaranteed success of the spectrum.

If you moslty care about enjoying the story and not the PvP either don't buy and come back in a year/9 months or buy as a donation and come back. 

I will probably play only chapter 1, enjoy the co-op as training for PvP and dip my toes into the PvP super casually (I expect this journey to be around 20hs and have the potential to extend way more if I get enthusiastic with the PvP).

The game is in early days yes.
I grew up playing starcraft 1 and 2, diablo 2 and warcraft 3.
I'm not the sort of person to pay for cosmetics on a free to play game.
That said. If I can pay a bit of money for early access to the guys that gave me so much joy back in the day then I'm quite happy to do that. I owe them at least that much.
The gameplay is solid. 
I hope that these are these same guys that would make games that they wanted to play like the blizzard of old.

steam,171351844,"The potential man of Craft-series RTS.

The fundamentals for this to be phenomenal in 2 years are there, so if you're someone who wants to be wowed or plays a game only once, wait till some time after 1.0 release.

If you're buying into this now, then you'll see a game that needs at least a year of iteration in each of it's aspects. It really is early access.

- Campaign quality varies from mission to mission + there will be iteration and changes on these mission as they'll need to be reworked to support 3 players, so what we're getting here will be forced to undergo a change as time goes on;
- 1vs1 and melee related modes are incomplete (cries in infernal T3), but you can play both ladder and custom skirmishes vs AI;
- Coop is fine for this state of the game and there is a decent difficulty progression to climb through. As expected it doesn't go out of it's way do do super outlandish stuff just yet. However if you're a fan of playing fun games with friends - wait till user generated content is implemented, so you can bounce between official stuff and the user made modes (td's/tugs/survials/rpgs/custom campaigns/god knows what else);
- User generated content (ums/maps/mods). The editor won't come till 2025, and it'll come in parts, but when it does release I'm trilled to see all the assets and ideas from campaign/coop to be remixed by people with different ideas and styles :D

- Pricing: it's F2P, everything competitive is free, everything non-competitive you can try demos for free, but will have to pay if you want more. Prices might be stiff, but it is what it is. I'd rather pay 2x for solo/pve content packs than have the SC2 situation where it's not having any non PvP updates ever again till the end blizz.

Personally I've spent last 14 years in SC2 arcade, so I really wish for this to succeed. However I can see how people who don't care about this style of RTS in general, or don't care or even know about the endless PvE user generated content of sc/wc3 might have easy time dogpiling on this game, praising other extremely specialised games as something that does something specific better and are therefore better overall.

steam,171343565,"I played in all but one closed beta and seeing the progress in the last year gives me hope for the future. 
Considering they are graphically overhauling all the races, the progress they've done in 1 year is honestly impressive. Co-op would have been done as well, if not for the mistake FG made (more cartoony style initially).
The game looks great now. Celestial new art work looks promising. Campaign is good and fun - nothing special, but fresh. 1v1 is also fun and less punishing than SC2, though very similar in it's core - responsiveness, macro, maps etc. 
Don't get me wrong - Co-op was frozen for 6 months, 3v3 Mayham is coming in september, few units are still missing in 1v1, models will be changed. It's far from amazing, spectacular or must play, but FG showed in my opinion they can improve the game to become one, if given the time.

I think most RTS fans will find something interesting with this game.",1722675394,2024-08-03 04:56:34
steam,171342707,"I was following Stormgate since Frost Giant was hosting public discussions on the proper approach to developing new RTS games. What should the theme be? Should we focus on singleplayer or multiplayer? Should units die fast or slow? Should the game be easy or hard? And so on. They sold themselves as veterans in the RTS development scene, citing their involvement in great titles like Starcraft, Warcraft, and Command & Conquer.

When they finally announced Stormgate, I was really excited. I was able to get in the closed beta to try the game and it was... okay at best. My expectations were very low because the game was still in-development and the developers wanted feedback on what they were working on.

So I held of from following Stormgate on social media for a while and only played Stormgate whenever I got an email from Frost Giant saying they added new stuff in this and that beta run. I saw the initial responses already: the game is too cartoony, it looks like a Starcraft x Diablo rip off, the performance sucks, etc. I was still very hopeful as the developers responded to these comments and even made a lot of improvements.

Compared to the previous beta runs I played, they seemed to fix and polish a few things like models, terrain, and animation changes. They added a bunch of new features like the actual campaign mode, more heros in co-op, training wheels for new players, they fixed the performance issues, etc.

But after playing the campaign today, I'm really disappointed that I've waited for so long and this is what we get. The cinematics are big step backward compared to what they first showed. The first Stormgate cinematic was pretty rough but we all know Frost Giant isn't a big studio like Blizzard or Ubisoft who can pump out high quality cinematics every month. It was forgivable, so many users expected that the budget would go to the *actual* game.

Well, while there have been improvements, the game is still lagging from my initial expectations. For example, they claimed that pathfinding would be the same as the one in Starcraft II but I find a big clump of Exos to be a nightmare to manage. Some of them get stuck behind each other. In the third mission of Chapter 0, a prisoner got stuck behind some Exos so he couldn't become an Exo himself. He was bugged out behind the other ally Exos and I had to move them around with my character.

The animations are weird sometimes. When Amara shoots, the animation shows that the shot connects but no damage is dealt because you have to wait for the animation to reach a certain point before it registers as a hit and you can start a-moving. In the campaign (I played in Hard difficulty), Barclay and Ryker almost die on their own because they feel like jumping in and you have no way to control them until the battle is complete. They also can't pick up items so I have to wait for Barclay to heal up or tank with Amara because she can pick up healing items.

There are little lore tidbits scattered across the map. You can pick them up and read it from a little tool tip on the bottom right but I couldn't find a way to read it again once you've dismiss it. Additionally, there's no pause feature in the campaign.

The sound direction and voice direction is awful. I couldn't understand what some characters are saying. They sound like they're underwater (like Grift). Some sound don't feel in sync with the animations (like Amara's guns or the cinematics). The voice acting is rough with only a few characters delivering their lines well and clearly. If it weren't for the subtitles, I wouldn't understand anything. Their emotions are also over the place. It honestly feels like a big Shenmue 3 moment.

The cinematics are horrible. I think whoever is in charge of them seems to know and understand how to produce cinematics but the models used are uncanny and weird. I can't take Amara seriously with the way she looks.

After completing Chapter 0, I'm not willing to spend $10 for three additional missions which, at most, will probably take me an hour to complete. The story doesn't have me hooked at all. There's no mystery to it. The characters are boring and unlikeable. If the quality of the missions are the same as Chapter 0, then no thank you. For $10, I can pick up any other indie game on Steam with a better narrative.

After all these years, this Early Access launch really has me wondering what Frost Giant is up to. It's sketchy to release the game in its current state like this, especially for a studio that secured millions of dollars of funding which a lot of indie game studios could only wish to have. It's a bad first impression for your casual audience and the I've-never-played-an-RTS audience. In any case, I hope this disappointing launch will light your butt on fire to iron out all these issues.

With games seeing massive improvement over time like No Man's Sky, maybe you still have a chance here, Frost Giant. I'm still looking forward to 3v3 and your eventual 1.0 launch so I'll update my review by then.",1722674765,2024-08-03 04:46:05

Compared with other RTS games, the 3 factions feel VERY different from one another, with units typically having no equivalent in other factions.

If you are a fan of starcraft 2 and/or warcraft 3, this is the perfect game for you if you are open to change and acknowledge the fact that this is a small studio and that the game is far from being finished. There are of course coop (3 vs AI) and campaign however, id say you could potentially end up being disappointed given the fact that this is not a finish product and you most certainly feel it more when you play either of those 2 mods if you compare them to starcraft 2. Also, as of yet, there is no custom games and map editor so far, they will come later. Do not forget that starcraft 2 had 14 years to get where it is and it is a pretty dogshit company that has that IP, imagine 14 years of stormgate with this company now

ive played starcraft 2 for only about a year but i played warcraft 3 for multiple years, ive always thought that the time to kill in warcraft 3 was way too long and that the time to kill in starcraft 2 is way too quick. if you have the same feeling, this is the perfect game, it is literally a between the two and to me it feels so natural and better.

I am personally it a positive review for the 1v1 but also because i trust Frost Giant, something you can rarely say on a company nowdays. i have been following the project ever since it was announced and seen how they care about their product and their fan base. i have played their last 2 betas and still have as much fun and still see lots of improvement since the betas and its going in the right direction for sure.

Ive seen a couple of negative reviews concerning micro transactions. I am not a fan at all of them myself and hate games that are free to play for that reason. However i get the business strategy behind it and how it can attract people to it. i absolutely hate micro transactions but ill admit i can tolerate it when it is good studios behind it. (eg: path of exile). Now, the fact that they put out a hero champion to buy in the shop day one is kinda scummy, however, because of the backlash, they announced that they would give the next hero for free to everyone that paid for any founders which is a pretty good news overall but most importantly, shows how they listen to their fans.

I am not even sure i can pinpoint a single aspect that is 100% done in this game and yet, i enjoy the crap out of it, i personally never thought i could enjoy a game that much just by seeing the potential of it but also it says alot about how the gameplay is good

TLDR;

- 1v1 is awesome even tho it is not a finish product
- coop (3 vs AI) and campaign are lackluster, id recommend waiting 6 months or maybe even a year if you are not interested for 1v1
- Custom games and map editor are still not in the game as of yet
- Overall a very good studios that made a lot of progress over the last 4 to 6 months
- Blizzard is now a shit company that has also given up on their RTS genre and we need to move on to a better company in every regard
- Gameplay is sick since it is not as fast as starcraft 2 but still faster than warcraft 3
- Studio that listen to their fan base and cares about their product
- MTX on day one which got criticised but they decided to kinda backtrack and give next hero for free to everyone that backed",1722656218,2024-08-02 23:36:58

Now recommending this game given the current level of development and recent polish that's been passed over on the game; especially given that the core game is F2P, there's little reason not to give the game a try. However, I still don't think the campaign is worth purchasing yet, as it still requires some polish with respect to art, gameplay, and writing before it will begin to feel immersive and satisfying to play. Likewise, the co-op heroes are also not worth purchasing, as they still require a great deal of gameplay development before they provide a unique experience in this gamemode.

There is still a long way to go before Stormgate is comparable to existing RTS games, especially recent new releases, but the recent work they've put into beautifying the game and giving each race a distinctive art-style makes this a game worth trying, if nothing else. The unit pathing is decent, the game is responsive, they've fixed server issues and major bugs, and the recent addition of Stormgates into skirmish/melee makes the gameplay stand out and fun (albeit some additional balancing is needed).

Give it a try. I'll update my review again if things change.",1722652706,2024-08-02 22:38:26
steam,171328877,"Here are some ramblings and off the top of my head thoughts so far...

Having played through all 6 missions so far I have to say that I do recommend this is you are okay with not having a polished finished product. It amazes me still to this day that people have a hard time understanding what early access means. Not only that but Frost Giant has been very clear since the beginning that it isn't finished yet. I know people will think I'm defending a doa game, and they can think that but I feel the negativity it mostly coming from people who already have it set in their minds that they don't like the game because its not finished or they don't like the graphics. But I don't want to characterize all people that have an issue with the game in one brush as its okay to not like the game right now as its understandable if you're expecting a more polished game.

I understand the state of the game and accept that it is rough around the edges right now and everything will not be fleshed out on the outset. I was a little hesitant at first with the idea of an episodic release of the missions as I would have wanted a full release of the campaign but thinking about it if they are serious about continuing with the content at a regular cadence then that would mean we will get more than the average RTS release in the years to come. 

As you can tell I'm more interested in the campaign and not really a 1v1 player. I have always loved the Warcraft 3 campaign and played it maybe 10 times. Mostly for the nostalgic aspect but also the missions are really good and still hold up. It sounds silly but i really do attribute the warcraft campaigns for me getting into animation as a career, I am currently working in tv animation on 2d and 3d shows on high profile franchises but I hope to get into game animation in the future. Some of the people working on Stormgate helped make Warcraft 3. And I want to thank them. Working in animation I have the insight of production schedules that many players do not and I can tell you that it can be chaotic at times especially when stuff goes off the rails from unforseen events that be a chain reaction of other things. schedules can change to accommodate things that are falling behind, which is what we are seeing from the latest blog post they released. 

Not to harp on this too long but, as someone in animation the best way I can explain what is happening and why people are upset by the look and feel at the moment, and bare with me and I know most people will have an idea of what happens to make animations but in case you don't. When making an animation you start off with blocking it out. It looks decent, and gives the overall idea. Then you go into spline mode which makes all your poses interpolate from pose to pose and now it looks horrible and you feel like quitting. You didn't put enough poses for the interpolation to work properly as there is not enough information for the computer to make the animation cool. Now you have to go back and add more poses and tweaks before it starts to feel grounded, real, and what you envisioned, and then you polish which gives the last 10% to really make it pop. That is the normal way to animate, which is to get the idea across first, then it looks bad because you have hundreds of other things to finish before you can go back and address the issues of the animation looking bad as it is just in the blocking step. Where Frost Giant is right now is at the end of the blocking phase in their journey, they blocked everything out(1v1, coop, campaign) and they hit spline and now it looks the way it does and now they have to go back and flesh out everything again. This is completely normal but i understand if people don't want to be around for that.

As for the story, there are no more stories left to tell that will wow audiences. What we like in stories is what the characters evoke in us and to understand their motivations. There are also lots of plot devices that can be used to catch us off guard. But the derivative nature of Stormgate is very apparent as it is very inspired by Warcraft 3, and I'm okay with that I'm not looking for blockbuster story telling but a fun and engaging campaign with the hopes that in years to come they will refine and improve on all aspects like writing, voice work, effects, and animation to get the message across. The campaign is there it just needs to be reiterated on and then polished for it to stand up on its own feet. 

So far in its rough state I can tell that if they continue making campaign content ill stick around and play them. I get the same feeling I get the same feeling I got playing the warcraft 3 campaigns, is it 100% the same quality one to one, no, but it will take time. The foundation is there for a great game and can give me the content we RTS campaign lovers have been starved of for far too long. I also look forward to the custom maps and content as that was a huge part of my warcraft 3 days.

Anyways, if you love finish campaigns and want more than 3-4 hours of gameplay maybe hold off until next year when they will have more content and it will be more polished. But if you want to support them like I have to help support their development of the game then I recommend it! Without sounding too much like a fanboy the concept of early access is to help develop the game as the company did not set out to make the game the traditional way of finding a publisher, as publishers usually own the IP and FG wants to retain those rights so that they can make important decisions creatively with the game. The trade off of not going the publisher route is they have to find funding through venture capital and crowdfunding which they have all done and then also early access. If we were talking about them being funded from a publisher and launching the 1.0 game today it would be a different story for sure. But them going the way they did gives them more options and pivot instead of having a to communicate with a publisher.

steam,171327393,"Stormgate is quite rough around the edges, but its core gameplay scratches the competitive rts itch perfectly.

In early access, it is largely missing the robustness necessary to support a claim that it rivals that of a Starcraft Broodwar, SC2, or Warcraft 3. But as someone who was passionate for all three, Stormgate has successfully recaptured that Blizzard-Style RTS feel. 

Stormgate has an amazing competitive 1v1 mode that is personally more fun for me than both broodwar and SC2 (and enjoy ranked on both of those games, bw > sc2), but it is missing a ton of casual features and the devs are making a massive blunder with their current monetization strategy which targets said casuals. However, I've been part of the playtest long enough to understand how well FrostGiant handles player feedback, and I'm very hopeful they will correct their course. 

This is coming from someone who originally hated everything they showed about Stormgate. In fact I was a passionate hater of the game until I put a good 5 hours into the game. After which, I couldnt stop playing it, even chose to play it over Broodwar!!!

In all honesty, I dont understand why this game is so fun, but the competitive 1v1 is my new (healthy) addiction.

OVERALL 7/10
1v1           9/10
Co-op       6/10
Campaign 2/10
MicroTs     0/10

As you can see, the ranked mode heavily skews my review, as that is the reason why I enjoy RTS. If you like a competitive 1v1 game like Broodwar or WC3, you'll enjoy this game. If you enjoy modern SC2, you might be put off by the longer TTK and not being able to blow up your opponents whole army in less than a second.

If you are a casual player, SG needs more time  to cook. The campaign is pre-alpha quality and I could only play a mission before I was blind and my keyboard was soaked in my own vomit (from the cutscenes and uninspired mission design). I'm being dramatic, but it does need a lot of work.
The co op is quite fun, but there is a serious lack of missions and the commanders cost significantly more than SC2 co op commanders despite being far less complete.
If the devs read this, please look at helldivers 2 for an acceptable microtransaction strategy and then build from there (more Cosmetics!)

I still have to recommend the game because of the innovative features that take away much of the tedium of old school RTS and the high level of skill expression baked into the gameplay. Stormgate is so fun and I LOVE DEMONS!",1722650242,2024-08-02 21:57:22

steam,171326423,"Diablocraft has a few issues but ultimately I would recommend it.  Keep in mind as you read this review that I am a hapless nobody who found out about this game randomly searching for something to fit the Starcraft hole.  Idk what's going on or has gone on in the discord or the open betas.  I also usually play RTS for the campaign missions and the one off match against the CPU because I suck something fierce in competitive.  So far for me it has been scratching that RTS itch and I look forward to how it will shape up once it is finished.  To me it seems like an obvious recommendation when it becomes F2P provided it doesn't go the route of most other F2P games where they become stale shells of games and focus on microtransactions.  If it stays true to itself like Path of Exile while being F2P then like yeah, get it and at least try it.  Apparently you can already buy heroes in the current state.  I have no idea if they affect the gameplay or are like an avatar/cosmetic thing.  As I said, I stay away from the competitive side.  

The core gameplay, while not revolutionary, checks all the boxes.  It some nice QoL features like setting a rally point on your hero which comes in clutch.  Quick building for structures, units, and researches, which is all very nice and helps the player manage things without having to jump back and forth across the map so much to select buildings or take up number+ctrl groups.  The story is nothing groundbreaking like it's literally Diablocraft - angels, demons and McGuffins - but I'm still interested in it all the same.  My biggest gripe is the fact that the game does not pause ever - not during 1v1 matches against the CPU and not even during campaign unless I'm really stupid and missing something here.  You also have no way of saving during a campaign mission (again unless i'm really god damn dumb and missing something).  Other than that I guess I would say I don't particularly care for the art style, but like that's totally subjective.  The graphics look good though all things considered.  Saw someone say the original Warcraft 3 has better graphics and that's just total hyperbole.  Graphics aren't GTA 6 but they're a little better than Starcraft 2, which take it or leave it.  Personally for me, it doesn't ruin the experience.  Music is whatever.  It's your cookie-cutter sci-fi/fantasy score.  Sound design is good though, can hear everyone and everything clearly. 

Now if you want to spend money on it before it goes to F2P is another thing where I can't recommend or not recommend because that depends entirely on the situation.   I have the money, I'm really hoping this game shapes up to something, so I had no problem shelling out $60.  I figured ""3 extra campaign missions?  Sure why not.""  To me the game feels like it's worth $20 currently, and my metric for that is $1/hr and I can see myself playing this game for 20+ hours.  So if you got at least $20 to spend on a game and you want it to be an RTS this is a good one to spend it on I think especially if you got buddies to play 1v1 with.  $40 or $60 is legit only if you really want the extras for some reason (not worth the extra cash on their own imo) or you just want to show some love and won't be too freaked out if the game should tank.  I will say I do think the potential is there for it be a really good game and I'm rooting for it, but it's been getting hate and the possibility of it going belly up is definitely there.",1722648684,2024-08-02 21:31:24

steam,171324611,"CON: When this is F2P you'll be able to play the first three campaign missions to see what your tolerance level is for wokeness. It's not subtle at all, and feels like the campaign was written out completely before getting woke corrections from a contractor.
PRO: co-op and multiplayer are free of this. If you resolutely ignore what the contractor did here, the campaign is still playable and serves as a tutorial for the co-op missions. There's also some humor to be found.

PRO: you like SC2? This is more SC2 but with a huge shakeup, as the factions really aren't just reskins. It delivers on SC2-like gameplay, both playing and watching someone play it. The design of the factions is also deeper than first impressions, as it's not just ""humans and demons and angels"".
CON: having some interesting lore doesn't excuse it looking exactly like ""humans and demons and angels"". The factions are jarring on their own, especially the units with too-human faces, but they really suffer when compared to SC2 factions. The Zerg aren't just iconic because they were in a successful game. I remember playing SC1 for the first time and seeing the Zerg, and I remember skipping the entire Terran campaign and being blown away by the Overmind's introduction because the Zerg just looked [i]so cool[/i]. Some of Stormgate's units look OK or interesting but [i]none[/i] of them look cool, even the Vulcan has tiny legs and tripod feet.

PRO: 3vAI and 3v3 is an interesting focus that gives you a reason to play this game even if you're happy with SC2. As you level up in co-op your army becomes more distinct, with modified units replacing base-game units. The co-op missions are also pretty good, if a little familiar. Co-op also has better voice-acting than the campaign.
CON: 3v3 isn't out yet and the co-op heroes are very boring compared to SC2 co-op heroes.

steam,171316797,"This review is coming from a sc2 veteran (finished all the campaigns on brutal, had all coop commanders at max level and reached diamond in 1vs1 in the last 3 seasons):

The game is in a very good state considering how long it was in development and the size of the team. Additionally, I think the rate at which things have developed and improved is very impressive for such a small studio (compared to Blizzard). 
HOWEVER, please note that as the developers disclaim, the Game is in Early Access (EA). This means that some things are under-cooked, or/and need to be improved.

- Campaign: 
The least finished part of the game. I enjoyed the first 4 missions gameplay so far. These concepts of missions I have seen before in Warcraft 3 (WC3) and Starcraft 1/2.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. They will have time to innovate later. HOWEVER, the cinematics and cutscenes between the missions need a lot more work (this is regardless of their artistic choice which I personally don’t mind). If the sole reason for you to play the game is to just enjoy the story and get immersed in the fantasy universe that the campaign is supposed to offer, I think you need to wait more. 
The lack of a Pause option is also a bit off-putting. I like to think of campaign as the chill mode of the game where I can go and answer my door if needed (ideally a save/load would also be nice). I am sure these will come later, but for now they are missing, and this can be frustrating.

-	1vs 1:
I only played a bit of custom skirmishes vs AI to learn the mechanics of vanguard (played terran in SC2). The game feels as good as SC2 (it might be even better but it’s just hard to notice past sc2 level of performance imo). I am looking forward to play more 1vs1 in the future. This mode seems to be the best so far, and I personally think they manage to lower the skill-floor without making the game “easier” for competitive players.

-	COOP:
I only played the tutorial with Blockade (I have 3 other heroes). It seems that for now, all heroes basically have more or less access to at least a version of the units from their factions. I do not mind this for these first commanders, as it makes any enemy composition manageable. However, in this regard, this game-mode feels like a WC3 mod right now. I hope that in the future they will create some unique units that will not be seen in 1vs1 (similar to SC2) just for COOP.
TLDR:
The game is on the right path, but the campaign is not ready. If you like to play 1vs1 or you were a try-hard in SC2 coop, you would probably enjoy these modes for sure. My advice is to wait until it is free to play, then test whatever is offered and see later if you would like to purchase anything extra. 
PS: I have bough the ultimate EA pack and I do not regret it one bit. Personally, I do not mind supporting Frost Giang getting this game better and hopefully ready soon. But if you ask my honest opinion, the game in the actual state is not worth more than you are willing/ afford to pay.

steam,171316570,"The Early Access only really caters to competitive RTS players. As a competitive RTS it's pretty much already working. Units are fun to play with / against. Designs seem familiar yet different. The microing is for the most part really satisfying (When the pathing isn't super derpy).

Obviously, since the Early Access is mostly for the Ladder Tryhards, and the game lacks an Unranked Matchmaking, I don't think there's much a casual player can do atm. I only played one Co-Op mission, and the first 3 campaign missions and it was entertaining, but you can tell it's not a finished product.

I guess the only real complaint I have is the lack of a good replay function (The one in the game is super bare-bones) & not having an unranked matchmaking.",1722634507,2024-08-02 17:35:07

steam,171315546,"I really wanted to like this game. I did. Unfortunately, the biggest problem is that everything feels like a blander copy of original blizzard games (The vanguard are just bargain bin versions of Overwatch characters- see the main character as Tracer and the knight with the hammer as Reinhardt-, the demons are just the villains from Diablo without any of the intrigue or menace, unit responses directly quote units from Starcraft constantly, etc.). Overall it makes for a frustrating experience in which the new game feels so derivative of other games that it starts to lack its own identity and makes you wish you were playing those older games instead.
In terms of art, I generally like stylization in artstyles, but the art here doesn't stand out in a good way; it feels like the artstyle is clashing between the high fidelity terrain and buildings and the incredibly cartoonish look of actual units- either one would be fine, but both is highly unappealing. Additionally, all units within factions look too similar, making fights incredibly difficult to judge and buildings are too complex to read quickly. Compare this to Starcraft II (The most obvious influence), in which units and buildings stand out nicely both from the terrain and from each other so that each is immediately identifiable. Also, I feel that the camera is too close, and the game would be better immediately if it was zoomed out a bit to give a wider view.
In terms of gameplay changes, I understand that the game is in early access, but there is practically nothing to teach you anything about the game at the moment. Generally, that's what a campaign is for, but currently, there is only the early part of the Vanguard campaign available, which does a very poor job of introducing anything beyond the most basic tenets of the Vanguard faction. You don't even macro against the demons at any point, meaning you can't even learn about them in an adversarial format. As for the additions of the quick menu, I personally couldn't get the hang of it in the time I played, and if they help someone else get into RTS I'm glad it exists, but thus far it feels to me like its automating too much of the simple fun of controlling your base and macroing up. This might change if I come back to this game and I might find its a godsend for avoiding all the little annoyances that make older RTS harder, but for now I'm not a fan.
As mentioned above, I didn't like how derivative the characters were, but, I feel the story deserves its own section as well. The three available missions do basically nothing to endear me to these characters, and the plot feels incredibly random. The opening cinematic (Though at least appealing to look at) does absolutely nothing to set the stage for the story we're actually playing through, which itself already suffers from having little to no internal momentum. The only thing propelling the narrative beyond the first mission is that one of the civilians you save is a traitor for reasons that are not well explained or foreshadowed. The characters somehow know that he's a traitor, despite there being no indication of this earlier to my knowledge, and because we need more missions, this then segues into following some demons to find a magical sword. Nothing here makes me want to continue this campaign, none of the mystery is anything nearly as interesting as the zerg invasion that started Starcraft I or II or the plague that started off Warcraft III, and the characters are so unmemorable that I can't for the life of me remember Discount Tracer's name, despite her being all over the promotional material and being one of the coop commanders.
Again, I understand this game is in early access, but the free release is just 11 days away as of writing this, and unless the devs are really holding out with some incredible course correction, I think this is just another dead-on-arrival RTS, still unable to clear the bar set by Starcraft II almost fifteen years ago.
I'll probably give this another try at some point, but I'm incredibly unoptomistic about the future of this game. Here's hoping that ZeroSpace will be better.",1722633217,2024-08-02 17:13:37
steam,171314802,"Early Access, I have a lot of hope for it. 
Especially for the 3v3 that's gonna debut in 2025. 
Coop is still a bit meh, it has a good direction so far but it needs more, the first 6 campaign missions are nice and the 1v1 ladder is pretty awesome actually. 
It's still super rough, it feels very much like an alpha or even pre-alpha, a lot of missing feedback in the sfx, vfx and UI of the game. But the gameplay is there, it's fun, u can micro and macro, canon rush, play a macro game, do timing attacks, all-ins ect. The balance is not there yet which is frustrating sometimes, but that's kind of why we're here, we're testing, and we're living through Stormgate's humble beginnings.

steam,171313868,"EA review preserved below. A lot of how I felt then is true now. Have they improved the campaign from their original showing? Yes. Do I still feel like this game is a far cry from the game they hyped to lure people in? Super yes. Despite being better the campaign feels soulless and the story is far from compelling. On top of that, they now have a new ultimate pack for sale that trumps the prior ultimate pack they sold on their Kickstarter? The whole thing is just scummy, amateurish, and disappointing. If you're looking for ""we have Starcraft/Warcraft at home,"" this is it. Unfortunately, Starcraft 2 came out 14 years ago and was/is better than this game.

----------------

From what I can tell, they only really dialed in the 1v1 multiplayer feel for this release. For anyone that's interested in the campaign or coop, it ranges from laughably bad to mediocre. Add to that the evident lack of polish and content and you can begin to understand why people are upset. That's not to speak of an ""ultimate"" early access pack that does not even include all the day one content in the game currently (while promising other content at some nebulous point in the future). To be clear, the description of the $60 pack is not deceptive, it's just disappointing.

I was very excited for this game and I hope that they're able to turn it around but I feel like they did themselves a disservice by releasing anything other than the PvP multiplayer modes at this point. It's a first impression they can't get back.",1722631300,2024-08-02 16:41:40

steam,171312910,"Unfortunately, as much as I want to give the game a better review, it has disappointed me somewhat. I was one of the first to support the game from its initial versions, and unfortunately, there are still things that need improvement.

The pathfinding in the game is truly terrible; units often get confused when trying to take the best path to the enemy unit or a specific area on the map. This is not to mention the times when clicks apparently fail to register. This could be a server-side issue rather than a client-side problem, but it is crucial in an RTS game that is supposed to be advertised as a ""next-generation"" RTS.

The movement animations make it seem like the units are floating, contrary to how they appear in other RTS games like SC2 or WC3. In SG, the units seem to walk very quickly, and the animation doesn't correspond to the distance they cover in the game. This makes them feel and look unnatural, giving them a ""weird"" feeling, to say the least.

There is a lack of information in the game's tooltips. Some abilities or buildings do not have a complete description of what they do, which confuses new players.

There is a lack of customization for hotkeys.

The game's art style, although disliked by many, seems ""fine"" to me. It's a different style from what other RTS games have accustomed us to. It is true that it needs refinement. For instance, the faces of female characters appear a bit ""harsh"" or ""masculinized,"" which I don't like. Another thing I would like to see is a graphical change that truly reflects when you have the settings on ""ultra."" From ""Low"" to ""Ultra,"" the change is minimal. I understand that FrostGiant wants as many people as possible to be able to play the game even with less powerful computers, but it makes having settings irrelevant if everything ends up looking the same.

The music is quite average. Although there is a theme with guitars that identifies the game, the rest is quite unremarkable.

I'm sure the balance will be reviewed soon, but currently, the Celestials seem quite strong.

I couldn't play the campaign, but I've heard it has problems with both its story and functionality. You can't pause or create custom save points.

Regarding monetization, it's obvious that a free-to-play game has to make money somehow, but the approach here feels incredibly aggressive. They could add cosmetics that you can earn by playing or achieving a goal in a campaign mission, for example, finish the game on brutal and get this skin for the console.

In summary, I think the game needs a lot of improvement, especially in animations, unit pathfinding, and terrain, without ignoring the art. It's incredible that the game reached Early Access with just a few improvements after the beta phase, but I have to be honest, it’s not what I personally expected. I would like to give it a positive review, but I can't. Hopefully, there will be improvements in the future that will transform it into the next-generation RTS it promises to be.",1722630208,2024-08-02 16:23:28
steam,171312705,"as of right now... it's a meh... 
the gameplay is fine. nothing great. the campaign is bad, and voice acting horrid.
played 1 co-op and it was decent, but couldn't queue up for another so quit.

steam,171312478,"[h2] The mixed pre-early access reviews are ""mixed"" for good reason. [/h2]

Some aspects are pretty fun, some are pretty bad. the worth of this product depends on what you want from an rts.

[h1] Campaign [/h1]

Its in a really rough state right now. Models look pretty bad in the in-engine cutscenes. the 3 free starting missions are pretty mediocre. the next 3 missions, which are purchasable, have more exciting gameplay hooks but are very rough and unpolished.  You'll get around 90 minutes or less of gameplay on hard, maybe double that if you replay them on brutal. 

Not really worth it at this stage in my opinion, but it could change in the future.

I'm concerned about how little content is expected to be produced for the campaign over time as well.

If the first mission dlc pack (which contains 3 mission) only gave me about 90 minutes of gameplay for three missions, its going to be a very slow process to tell the story of stormgate.

Future campaign dlcs are also expected to produce 3 missions each. according to the roadmap, 3 more missions will arrive this year, and an additional 9 by the end of 2025. if they all run about 20-30 minutes of gameplay, its going to be a hard sell to get me invested in a world with about 4.5 hours of gameplay per year.

Story lovers, this game aint it, yet.

[h1]1v1 ladder and private lobby[/h1]

This is where the game shines right now. There are 3 factions that play uniquely currently. The pvp element is pretty strong and its clear that this is where most of the initial development time and budget has gone. Things arent perfectly balanced, and one map is ridiculously in favour of a certain faction, but adjustments will be made constantly through the games life. Its like starcraft 2 but a little slower.  Units are a bit tankier on average, and your economy starts out slower and takes a little more time to build up. 

some people are experiencing performance issues and inconsistent bugs, but i've been having a pretty good experience so far with few issues.

Typically, competitive players are a rather small percentage of RTS players, but if this is your wheelhouse its worth checking this game out.


[h1] co op[/h1]

Mixed bag here. Co-op starts with 5 heroes that can be played until level 5 for free, and must be purchased to get them to level 10. 

The co op missions are basically just variants of what youd see in sc2. they can be fun, but are even more prone to performance issues and bugs at the moment. sc2 will offer you a much more comprehensive experience, but if youve played that to death and want some variety, this might slake your thirst for awhile.

Its free to try so you can check your performance before committing your wallet to anything. 


[h1]player created mods/game mode editor[/h1] 

not a thing yet, but is planned. if you spent a lot of time in the sc2 arcade, you'll have to wait awhile before seeing anything like that in stormgate.


[h2]tldr[/h2]

Campaign - not worth your money yet

1v1 ladder - Yes this is fun, play the game for this.

Co op  - Its limited but there is fun to be had if you arent experiencing technical issues.

Editor - doesnt exist yet

steam,171312077,"I love RTS, my favorite game in the genre was Starcraft 2 which I played for hundreds of hours in all modes.

That being said, I was looking forward for Stormgate but my expectation was very low. I started a couple days ago playing, and so far I'm having a lot of fun learning this new game. I love the gameplay, the use of creep camp, the large maps, the quick matches, the game performance, etc. Overall I feel like its a cool experience. 

Not a fan of the looks, like a lot of people, but I don,t mind the art style that much. However, they need to rework some unit and building looks, because to me, a lot of them are looking the same and it's hard to see what is what in a middle of a battle. Also, races need an urgent rebalance (which I'm not worried about, balancing races is a complicated and dangerous process where small changes can have huge impact, so I understand that we have to  stay patient and that the game will play way differently in the future).

Overall, I'm happy so far and I know this game will go up from here. If you don't like the game, I would advice sitting out the EA and wait a couple weeks or months and revisit the game. Otherwise, give it a fair chance, I think this could be a major game in the RTS genre for the next decade.",1722629228,2024-08-02 16:07:08
steam,171312000,"--Updated Stormgate Review - Patch 0.4--

Stormgate began as a true early access game, rough around the edges with a vision that wasn't fully realized. With the 0.4 update, those edges are starting to smooth out, and it's really beginning to find its own voice and shimmer as an RTS.

Let's cut to the chase - Stormgate has a lot to like, and with each update, it's getting significantly better. The 1v1 multiplayer continues to shine with varied strategies to figure out and learn. Every match feels like a new puzzle to solve, which keeps things fresh and exciting. The recent player number bump from Patch 0.4 has made the ladder a much more enjoyable experience with more even matchmaking, though it's still not perfect - something that can only truly be fixed with a larger player base.

The campaign missions are now a lot of fun with the new story direction. Vanguard coming back to Earth to reclaim it is thematically much more interesting than them being a rebel faction fighting back against the Infernal. The missions themselves have become genuinely engaging.

The new Infernal units look amazing and are really starting to pop. However, this does highlight the somewhat drab nature of older unit skins like Magmadons and Weavers. I think a re-skin is all they need (not necessarily a remodel) to bring them up to the new standard.

The increased game speed is quite refreshing and definitely an improvement, though it may be slightly overtuned and could pull back just a tad for my taste.

There's still a long way to go until 1.0, with all of the factions getting re-worked and many tier 3 units still not in the game. I understand a lot of people wanting to wait until 1.0 to jump into the action, but for those open to a not perfectly polished but fun experience, I'd love to see you on the ladder.

Though co-op has been put on the back burner for the time being, the developers have mentioned some big ideas and changes they have in store for it. I can't wait to see what they have cooking as it's one of my favorite modes, even if it's getting a little monotonous in its current state.

What really gets me excited is how much the game has improved with each update. I see the Frost Giant team putting in the work, listening to feedback and making big strides. I really hope this game finds its player base because it's a ton of fun, and watching its growth has been exciting. Considering the leaps they've made already, I'm psyched to see where things are at when 1.0 rolls around.

If you're an RTS fan willing to roll with some early access bumps, Stormgate is definitely worth checking out now more than ever.",1722629148,2024-08-02 16:05:48
steam,171311661,"great game especially for players newer to RTS game.
1v1 is the most polished part of the game with fun new mechanics like creep camps that give certain buffs, and mechanics to help newer plays like the auto build, auto train, and the upgrades menu's, which makes it much easier to macro.

the campaign is probably the least polished part of the game with bad cutscenes and writing that doesn't make me attacked to the characters, gameplay wise the first 6 mission were fun and challenging in their own ways.

though I have played the co-op the least, i still found it fun with a quite a few maps and a good selection of heroes that you can play for free, you just cant level them past level 5 unless you pay for them.

and lastly there's not much to the custom game other than you can play 2v2 in customs and there's 3 2v2 maps.

TLDR
campaign-good gameplay not good story
co-op-good gameplay good selection of maps, and good hero selection
1v1- good gameplay for noobs and pros alike, relatively balanced vanguard is a little weak, and celestials are a little strong.

2 I want to make sure that my opinions are based on facks from gameplay itself.
Its not good lads.
I can see this. 
A mismanagment of funds and resources. Inflated Egos . And/Or aither some complet lack of understanding or shady intentions.

They shot themself in the foot by marketing the game as ""NextGen""-It isnt.
They shot themself in the foot by singing theyr own praises how theyr ex Bliz form the golden era-So were is that Bliz gold era quality?
They shot themself in the foot by saying just how much money they made from crowd funding-So why cant we see all that money in the production?
They shot themself in the foot by initiating MORE crowd funding programs-It would seem that the initial 35mil was not enoth.
They shot themself in the foot by alredy having a hero not included in the ultimate pack so in esen ce day 1 DLC-How they didnt see the blowback from that is astauding and reeks of finacial desperation.

Now is it bad to play? No. i wouldent say it was bad. (iem a RTS crackhead tho so pls dear reader keep that in mind) Its not what they said it would be.  And the ""Its Early Access"" excuse wont work. Why? Becouse we can see the foundation of the game and its not impresive.

steam,171306343,"The sad reality is that if you're looking for a competitive RTS, Starcraft 2 is just...better. In every single way. This game lacks SO MUCH that Sc2 already has.

On the front end it seriously lacks replays, clans, whispers, groups, blocking, socials. The list goes on.

On the business end the gameplay feels like a game that is trying to ape Sc2, but loves Wc3...but didn't actually want to take anything from that game other than next to pointless creep camps...and it does both badly. Hotkey customisation, which should be a CORE thing, is incredibly limited. The graphics are ASS as well, I mean man, original Sc2 has better graphics and that game is like 20 years old. It just isn't on.

The combat doesn't feel ""weighty"" or impactful either. If you drop a Psi Storm in Sc2 there is a satisfaction to watching and hearing it churn up a ball of Marines...everything in Stormgate just feels flat. Mechanically it's a lot simpler than Sc2 and Wc3. One build button. One unit build button. One research button. Workers automatically go walk to resources following a build. No real need to macro control groups for your structures. 

Connectivity has been an issue as well, meaning I played less than my listed time. 

The game feels like it doesn't know what it wants to be, and ends up being a poor clone of the titles that inspired it...and I feel pretty ripped off paying £20 for this turd :( I should have waited for F2P.

Couple of critiques - 

The art style is kind of weird and takes some getting used to. The factions are basically heaven, hell, and humanity, but add space themes. Watching a couple of streams I was having trouble distinguishing individual buildings when I was just learning. 

There may be a couple of units that need some additional tuning. Right now there are a few timing pushes that are incredibly difficult to hold.

I hope that future updates can change my opinion, but I'm just not having fun playing this game.",1722619000,2024-08-02 13:16:40
steam,171302328,"Update 8/6/2025 - This is my third time reviewing the game on steam.  For those following each review (thanks Mom!), at early access launch I gave it a D- saying there were hints of good there but the game as it was, if just further polished, wasn't going to be very good.  The story and art in particular were big let downs, but the gameplay, while fine, also didn't do much to differentiate itself from other RTS.  Then with the 0.4 release when they completely redid their campaign, voice acting, story, and art,  I upped it significantly to B- saying what was there was now actually a pretty solid foundation, still felt early access so a lot of work to turn that foundation into something good, but this was a direction that could become a good game if given enough time in the oven.

Rather then just give an overall score again, as the game now differentiates ""in development"" modes from the finished ones, I'm going to focus on just the completed ones and score them individually.

Campaign - 9/10 : From what I understand, frost giant put themselves in quite the difficult financial position, choosing to completely redo their campaign from scratch in response to player feed back, but while it remains to be seen if that was a good business decision, from a player experience perspective it absolutely was.  What is here now looks good, plays good, sounds good, and actually has a decent story.  The hub world sections between fights in particular stands out, serving as both a nice breather, but also a brilliant way of expanding the games lore and helping us get to know and care about its characters, while still giving the player a lot of control over how much of that lore they engage with.  The credit system, with purchasable upgrades for units and general faction buffs, as well as the item/equip system, with different rarities, ads a fun rpg-ish element to everything as well as a feeling of account wide progression beyond just your heroes levels.  If I was to critique anything, it'd probably just be that the difficulty right now doesn't have a smooth climb.  The first 6 missions are fairly easy, while mission 7 immediately sees a HUGE spike in difficulty.

AI Skirmish - 7/10 : I love the idea of these special ai challengers, but at least at easy, the difficulty/ai could use some further tuning.  I'm not a great player, but I have been playing this game since early access launch, and RTS since Warcraft 1.  I was also Diamond in SC2 during Wings of Liberty.  So it was more then a little shocking when, despite trying my hardest, the easy mode ai challenger showed up on my door step very early on and smashed my face in.  I ended up winning because he focused too much on destroying my structures rather then my economy, allowing me to recover, but I feel like if it pushed me that close to death, a true beginner is going to really struggle, which is probably not what you want on easy mode.  AI tuning aside, the concept is fun and I appreciate the account rewards for doing this mode.

1v1 - 8/10 : I feel like I'm not really qualified to talk about this mode, as such a weak player, but from a weak players perspective I'm enjoying the factions and in particular the concept of the stormgates which encourage me to fight my turtle instincts and move out to engage lest my opponent gain significant rewards.  My only real complaint is that the player base isn't currently large enough to consistently find players near my skill level.  With a more robust player base, I suspect this mode would be a blast.

Is this Game finally worth trying? - If you like a good pve campaign, yes.  If you like co-op, no, that modes still in development.  If you like 1v1, yes with the caveat that until this game builds a larger player base, the difficulty of your opponents will likely vary more widely then a more established RTS 1v1. 

Special note: The campaign can be purchased in game for significantly less (25 USD at the time of this update) then it costs on the steam store (this is because the steam store bundles come with various additional stuff, including cosmetics and content for the in development co-op and 3v3 modes).  If you just care about campaign, I highly recommend going that route.  Also the first couple of missions in campaign are free so don't be afraid to try those out before spending any money if your feeling uncertain.",1722618832,2024-08-02 13:13:52
steam,171302265,"The Game is a REALLY shallow copy and paste job of Starcraft 2. I wish that was hyperbole but to be entirely honest I feel thats just the plain and honest truth.

Each faction is just a near-exact copy of their starcraft counterparts.
- Vanguard are just SC2 Terrans with less diverse (not cringe DEI diverse) unit selections, which applies to all the other factions tbf. The worker units have the same voicelines as the SCV's from SC2, just in a dead robot voice and they feel out of place. All of the other units can be traced back to an equivalent they've been reskinned from. EXOs are just Marines, Vulcans are just Thors, etc.
- The Infernals are just the Zerg from SC2 with a reskin. So much so they have a creep mechanic renamed to something else but functions the same and their units sacrifice themselves to build structures. The demons are all really lame and toned down from what they could've been both aesthetically and gameplay-wise. Additionally they have all the same problems as Vanguard with poor unit diversity.
- The Celestials are just reskinned Protoss from SC2. They have Pylon equivalents, which you will be just as annoyed with as the original article. A Limit of structure building outside the range of the Pylons and units that are very clearly reskinned zealots, etc. etc.

Honestly the worst part of the shameless copy-and-paste job of the factions isn't just the blatantness of it, it's the uncompelling sanitized aesthetic they all have. It took the already toned down gringy vibes all the SC2 factions had from the first game and ran them through an Overwatch filter, drowned it in bleach and powdered it in DEI cringe. On paper everything in summary sounds super cool and compelling!

""An RTS where three factions vie for dominance. The Human Vangaurd whos tenacity and adaptability carry them into the fight. The Infernal Host, literal demons from the pits of hell coming to cull all life and dominate in hellish bloody fashion! And the Celestial Armada, an alien race of angels coming to purge the infernal host and all those they may corrupt!""

Yet... In execution it's all so lackluster and apathetic. It's like Frost Giant Studios forgot they were free from Activision Blizzard and weren't beholden to the limits of their established franchises. Neither from a gameplay standpoint nor an aesthetic one. I'm sure their are plenty of RTS hungry mad-men out there that will play and love this game regardless of all this given this vein of RTS hasn't been revived in over a decade. But I'm not so starved as to have forgotten what my last meal was. And I can't say my last meal with all the flavor, seasoning and presentation ripped out of it is a compelling dish I'll wast my time on.

Seriously. Just play SC2, it's free and you get the same exact experience with at least a bit more soul in it.",1722618768,2024-08-02 13:12:48

steam,171294850,"So the game have released into early access.
I understand where many of the complaints are coming from, and in it's current state it is indeed incredibly rough.

However this is a ""true"" early access, not a preview demo, but what most would call ""alpha"", textures aren't done, modelling aren't done for cut-scenes and more, if you look back at baldurs gate 3 when it released in early access it was equally rough around the edges, but that's the point, I do feel 1 year is a bit optimistic, but the game is nowhere near done.

the Improvements between the 3 tests have been significant, new units, new factions and a lot of ""gameplay"" polish.
even went from no ultrawide support to perfect support on my super ultrawide monitor.

that said, I strongly recommend people wait to the F2P early access release, and try out the game itself with no strings attached, I personally don't like 1v1 matchmaking pvp which is the games most fleshed out feature at the moment, but I have immensely enjoyed 3vsAI co-op, and I've played a lot custom matches me vs bots&friends

judging by the progress from first ""test"" to now, which have been 4-5 months, am I not worried about the game,
I do suspect that it might still be rough in 1 year from now, as lots needs to be done, but I can deeply respect focus have gone into the foundation itself ( gameplay ) doesn't matter how pretty and shiny the game is, if the gameplay sucks.",1722612217,2024-08-02 11:23:37
steam,171294836,"Currently in early access: 1v1 is super fun. Campaign is okay. coop is okay, but it does need another celestial hero. Devs listen to feedback well. Art style is relatively controversial and you like it or you don't. No 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 currently outside of custom matches. 
Campaign missing some core features like saving and pausing, but the pvp is in a good feeling place. The games are quick and snappy and the creep camps are a super cool addition. Then, the QOL features like global build and training issues really help macro as opposing to using control groups to do simple stuff like train units. While this could theoretically lower the skill ceiling, the game is very micro heavy with loads of casters.

A lot of us who have played classic RTS are in our 30s and 40s. However, the game currently feels like the 12-year-old version of SC2. Cartoonish, hollow characters that are difficult to connect with, and an extremely poor plot. 

Yes, I know this is early access. Yes, there will probably be many improvements. But incremental changes won't fix the vision behind the game. A vision that maybe, just maybe, will resonate with my 12-year-old son. And I'm not so sure about that either.

steam,171289684,"The ""ultimate"" pack ends up being ""not everything"" pack.

Gameplay wise; the units have great pathing. Camps are a cool idea, but rushing at the moment is very strong and camps are often ignored in favor of harassing the enemy. So camps kind of become an after thought. This is after they buffed the camps to offer more rewards, at the cost of being stronger or harder to take down. 

Campaign is a paid experience, and the missions are quite short. The main hero is just a PO'd bossy lady. Uninspiring to say the least. 

Graphics look like a mobile game. Very disappointing. 

I would refund if I could.

Edit: Well, looks like the devs are of the mind that even the most basic of criticism is worthy of a warning. They have taken action against my comment in their forum. 

This most likely means online interactions, which are NOT RATED, are going to be regulated with rules that the devs base on what they personally like or don't like.

HARD PASS LOL

Edit: So.. remember the ultimate pack I mentioned... they added a new ultimate pack.

You can see where this goes. In a few months time. There will be a new ultimate pack. More money. More stuff. Could my review get any more critical... sure.. however. I'll save them the embarrassment. They are already surely ashamed of themselves.

+ fresh races and mechanics
+- some QoL in controls (but it has a lot of work to be done yet)
- pathfinding and unit AI in general are terrible at this point (this will be improved eventually)

Having your single-player campaign online only and with no pause is not just dumb but completely unjustified. I'm not even going to talk about the quality of the story and it's monetisation. Developers usually increase prices after EA is done. The prices this game has started with surpass both SC2 and W3 reforged, especially when you take into consideration what you're paying for. Even W3 reforged offers better quality despite being a shitty remake of an old game that changed practically nothing except for graphics.

steam,171283396,"I have changed my review after recent events.

This game has been pretty clowned on, and for some good reason, however some of the things are pretty tough. The team simply ran out of money and had to put the game out before it was ready, and putting it with microtransactions. The game looked unpolished, the gameplay left a lot to be desired, and the campaign was just an outright scam.

However, the team got a new art director, and from what they showcased, they are really making massive strides in the art and campaign departments. The gameplay does feel slow compared to games like starcraft 2, but that's fairly easy to address, and so I'm not too worried about it. This game has a lot of promise, and the team has really truly shown that they are willing to do what it takes.",1722598782,2024-08-02 07:39:42

steam,171282436,"EDIT: 6 months after my initial review and yeah nothing really changed in terms of whatever I addressed here on August 2024. I had 3 hours+ game time and just didn't come back for 6 months. Now I am back to check, yep, stalemate. I don't know what FGS is really doing, they gotta buck up. Poor guys whom backed the most expensive choice...

Review at August 2024:
I too, amongst many, bought the founder's pack and awaited this glorious game to be released into EA because we believe in something created by SC2 veteran devs.

Generally, the gameplay looks and feels pretty good, very SC2-inspired way of RTS styling. But I couldn't ignore the almost toy-soldier/toy-like models for every single unit/building. Let us give FGS time to polish that aspect. The UI feels a little too basic at this point even for SC2 veteran devs. The victory splash is exceptionally poorly done imo.

I am also a little disappointed to not have animated unit portraits. Perhaps that isn't a priority for FGS, sure, let them cook this a little longer. The in-game cutscenes lets you view the models up close and yep, it is very poly-ish, I am sure they will polish them further again.
The campaign is pretty darn weak though...bonus objectives locations aren't highlighted on the minimap, voiceover dialogue has sentences spoken wayyyy too softly, like other reviewers shared - can't pause, can't save and if you press quit by accident - there is no ""Are you sure?"" prompt. The story is not gripping because it felt rushed - people can feel this very very easily.

Amara, looks nothing like her father too. Little girl Amara does but, adult Amara does not. Not sure what's up with this design decision of their main character. The campaign's main villian had some corny lines and the voiceover I just felt it didn't resonate that well. Kinda a shame that the campaign's first chapter has way too much in common with SC2 campaign missions - they struggling to come up with something original or tapping into SC2 player's nostalgia for SC2? Idk man...

I was shocked at the decision for microtransaction on Co-op heroes, real shocked. They only give you 1 hero free to use for the Vanguards but no free hero for the Host and Celestials. At least SC2 gave us free Kerrigan and Artanis...
At this early of a stage for their EA, throwing microtransaction at us really increases the sourness I am already tasting. They even wanna sell you extra pets.

Definitely Stormgate at this stage really needs tons of work aesthetically. I know I have many complaints in this review and so does others but can't blame us, FGS kept marketing about their team of veteran devs, so, some sort of high expectations is bound to be garnered within the community, no?

Together with many others, I will be keeping a hopeful eye on Stormgate, wishing/hoping/awaiting for it's constant improvements! Keep it comin' FGS!",1722597443,2024-08-02 07:17:23

steam,171281465,"In its current state, likeable for a specific audience; but [b]unsure if more generic players will, for now[/b]. As a comfortably platinum, occasional diamond SC2 player, I comment based on my far-from-expert, but have-spent-time-playing-RTS competency level.

TLDR: Clunky UI, buggy and crashes. Visually ugly. Well, it is early-access, as advertised. I've only played 1v1 and I enjoy it quite a lot. The 20th hour was a lot more fun than the first five. Hoping this game continues to improve and refine itself toward perfection.

[b]Issues[/b]
Quite a lot. The game crashes. Hotkeys customisation is limited (CTRL, Shift, etc modifiers are not customisable). Replays are buggy, no player information tabs included yet. No player pov, vision etc. Units disappear during replays. 

Main menu doesn't remember your last played race, so have to click on the desired one before ""Finding next match"".

Pathfinding is clumsy. Gameplay interface is clumsy, eg spells like the Hexen's recall [forget the actual name] spell can't be cast via minimap, the way you can in say Battle Aces, SC2, etc. It'd be fixed in time I'm sure, but in current state, you have to live things like that.

[b]Playing[/b]
Great potential. Looking forward. Unit movement and killing things feels much slower than it did in SC2. Because of this, consequently the skirmishes last longer, so there is more time to size up the fight and actually pull out even after taking a few hits before it goes awry. Everything feels ""tankier"" and less fragile than it did SC2. It feels different: You can't exactly ""drop-and-snipe"" buildings anymore and workers don't die as easily to harassment. Some will like this, some will hate this change.

Maps are larger, there is more room for manoeuvring and accumulating, more room for hidden expansions, more leeway for splitting armies, regrouping and flowing through different paths. I like this aspects of the play a lot. So unlike SC2 where you commit to a battle and a winner/loser emerges after a few seconds, in StormGate, retreating, recuperating, ambushing, cornering, are far more executable aspects of gameplay, more than just stalker kiting, or Muta zoning was.

The gameplay themes of both the Vanguard and Infernal are quite noticeable. Infernal for instance has a nice twist to what Zerg was. Instead of a ""fast and numerous horde"" , it's now a ""slowly amassing, meaty encroaching infestation"" in the case with Infernal. Yet to try Celestials, but it seems like they wanted to turn cheesy proxy building strategies into designed mechanics proper.",1722596267,2024-08-02 06:57:47

It doesn't have yet a ton of content, but feels good and is enjoyable. The vangard units design and the celestials are really cool. The infernals have interesting concept but I think they still need a lot of work to be really fun.
The coop and the campaign missions are also quite nice, but the worst part is the story of the campaign. The characters are so dull and shallow. Compared to the great writting of the wings of liberty and reign of chaos campaings, this is simply not there. It is really bad compared to them. I don't blame the developers that much because it is the sign of the times that they hace to care more about DEI and cool characters like Tychus are banned nowdays.

I believe they have shown a lot of still heavily in progress stuff to many people who have been more used to a beta that is merely a preface to a games full launch. The balance in 1v1 does need work and reminiscent of cannon rush time in some games. 

The campaign, i did not finish and only did the initial missions. As i personally wanted to come back to them when they had more time to cook to properly enjoy them. That statement in general can be placed on a fair bit of this game. That is why it is still early access. 

When it comes out. I recommend playing the Coop missions and just having fun. The heroes while simple give a spin to the races and it is just fun to have the hogs raid an enemy base.

steam,171273374,"A badly executed Starcraft 2

What I really like about this game is how you build units, buildings and upgrades. While you can, you don't have to select a worker and then a building and then a place, instead all buildings are under a panel that comes up with Q. The closest worker will build the building and then go back to gathering resources. The same applies for units and advanced units (W, E) and upgrades and advanced upgrades (R, T). This flow makes it much easier to do things and it is a nice quality of life feature. Unfortunately the positive end with this single well designed feature.

While playing this game it was really hard not to compare it Starcraft 2. After all, it is copy of that game. As in Starcraft, Stormgate has three races. One human, one advanced alien and one chaotic, infernal as they are called in Stormgate that very much resembles Starcrafts zergs. What I found most disappointing is that the similarities didn't stop with the races but even with the buildings and units which all had similar mechanics and roles with Starcrafts 2 units and buildings. The disappointment only continues with a campaign that lasts barely 2 hours and has poor cinematics, cliche lines and characters that look and behave as if they were just released from Arkham Asylum (do indulge to watch them on YouTube). I found that the CO-OP was the cherry on the top with offering only six commanders, only two of which, both human are free.

Only reason not refunded was because kick starter. 

Terrible dated graphics, it looks and plays like a Warcraft 3 mod. 

I bought into it because I loved the coop gameplay from Starcraft 2. The campaigns from WarCraft and StarCraft are some of my favourite gaming experiences. 

This is not that. 
If you ever watched Serral vs Maru game in SC2 and thought, yep I can do that, this is your sort of game.

If your more of a casual player like me who loved building fleets of carriers and void rays and watching them go wreck stuff.  Not for you.

Sure it's not fully cooked yet, and it needs a bit of balance and polish, but if you like competitive RTS games I bet you will have some fun trying out the different units and builds. The units are responsive, the different races have distinct identities, and everything is really snappy. The pace of the battles is a bit slower than SC2, which gives some good chances to micro during battles, even if you have slow hands like me.

I haven't tried the campaign yet, but I've heard that's a little rough around the edges so far. If you're only interested in the campaign and don't care about multiplayer, you may want to hold off just a bit longer to see how development progresses through early access.

Releasing an incomplete game through Early Access is still called releasing it. You can hide behind the ""well its early access"" delusion if you want. I'm not, especially because this game already had a closed beta prior to its Early Access release.

If you had dev time between the closed beta and now, and have footage of the map editor in a working state, there's no reason for it to not be there day one, when you've shown us that it's working

steam,171262791,"It just launched into Early Access and so it still needs (and will receive) a good amount of polish, but what's here already is extremely fun and feels like the spiritual successor to Starcraft 2 that Frost Giant Studios is going for. The factions are similar to, but also distinct enough from, the Terran, Zerg, and Protoss from Starcraft (and that's a good thing to my mind!), so you feel some familiarity while also having 3 whole new factions to learn, explore, and play. The gameplay itself feels really good. The campaign is definitely a bit rough in places, but the actual missions are a lot of fun and the story is interesting (if similar to RTS stories of the past in some places). The game has 1v1, 3 player coop vs AI with Heroes (commanders from Starcraft) and different missions, a campaign with 6 missions and more to come periodically, and will have 3v3 in the future as well. I am thoroughly enjoying it and if you're a fan of Blizzard-style RTS games, you probably will too!",1722565661,2024-08-01 22:27:41

You have 3 races that are thin facsimiles of the Starcraft races
Space Marines? Check
Alien Species that work almost identical to Zerg? Check
Protoss like advanced aliens but now holy? Check

I wish they would've done something that was original and didn't borrow so heavily from their previous games.",1722564839,2024-08-01 22:13:59
steam,171262238,"As somebody that rarely leaves reviews on games, I feel compelled to do so here.  The game wants to be WC3 so very, very hard.  I get it, it comes from old Blizzard devs before that company lost its way.  As far the story they're trying to do, it feels very unearned.  You didn't have to rush it the way you did in the first chapter.  It feels extremely tacked on and you'd be better just slowing it down and letting the characters breathe and develop.  They literally recreated 3 missions from human campaign in WC3, but whereas there they felt earned, here they just feel weird and disjointed.  Arthas had an arc, Amara is just bitter and vengeful from the get go and doesn't care.  Why should I?  (Don't get me started on cinematics, they are devoid of heart and soul).

I can see the attempts at quality of life improvements, maybe they're good, maybe they're bad.  I get they're trying to make RTS games more accessible for people.  As an RTS veteran this turns me off.  So you kind of need to pick your lane; do you want to make a game for the fans of the genre or do you want to water down the game so you can have mass market appeal?  It smells to me like they're trying to capture the early Blizzard energy, but they're missing the point and just doing to their version of WC3 and SC2 what Disney did to Star Wars (making a confused mess that nobody wants to touch, fans hate it, newbies don't care because it's shit both ways).  

I also get that it's early access, which is why I'm not criticizing too much on the technical execution.  They have time to fix that stuff.  No, my major complaints are that they're ultimately making a game with a story that (at this time) few will care about, about characters that are at best ""meh,"" and banking on MP giving it longevity (which I'm willing to bet it won't since it won't be a solid enough RTS) because the store for the microtransactions is already there.

So yeah, good luck to the devs.  You're going to need it.  In the meantime, I would just wait and see what happens with the game if you're contemplating buying.  I'm not going to be putting in much more time than another hour or so to mess around with some things.",1722564786,2024-08-01 22:13:06

Unlike SC2, I feel Stormgate has more potential to come back and not get stomped by a Terran medivac drop or a Protoss cannon rush or Zerg constant micro early skirmishes.  It is more forgiving and there's more in depth game mechanics to be explored.  Of course, I am rushing most games in Stormgate, but at least there's more dynamic to the game, such as I feel the games are longer, chaotic but manageable, and also like I said, forgiving, like comebacks are possible.  What I disliked about SC2 and as a Zerg player is how cheeses and one time moves that destroy a base is so hard to come back from.  I lose an army in Stormgate, and I can rebuild easily as an Infernals player.  I've only played seven 1v1 games so far, so it's an early impressions review.  But so far, it's making me feel like playing this game more and more as opposed to League of Legends or some other game where it can be annoying and disappointing -- a 1v1 game is all about me and my responsibility as opposed to having teammates and depending on how other's are doing as well, which honestly is hard to carry, I can carry myself in Stormgate, the beauty of RTS competitive gaming.

I've been testing the game and giving feedback since the early beta stages, and it's clear at this point that the developers lack a clear vision and lack the programming expertise required to deliver on their ambitious project. Many balance and design issues with the game are unfixed after multitudes of patches, or are made even worse in new patches, and the games engine is extraordinarily buggy and unpolished, with terrible performance.",1722560397,2024-08-01 20:59:57
steam,171259422,"I have changed my initial positive review that was based on the early access ultimate package. Being in early access status grants one a lot of leeway. That said, I don't dare to imagine the resources squandered in creating the poor excuse of a Starcraft re-imagining. To think how much more of a complete game could have been produced with better project management. Companies that  identify as a ""small studio"" should be far more careful with their output and be cognizant of what can or cannot be done with budgets. Also, why the heck would you hire Matt Mercer for voice acting when you cannot release a complete and polished game (Love Matt but cannot imagine he came cheap).

The part that stings the most in that my Wife, Son and I are huge RTS fans and purchased 2 deluxe and an ultimate pack only to find out what little was included when the game went live. There may have been some fine print in there but none of us were expecting a DELUXE edition to only include 3 paid missions (I think the Amara Co-op character and the chicken pet are the only other purchasable items included). So yes, we paid $100+ and did not get the 2 things each of us wanted, which were a finished 3 player co-op mode (which was a huge selling point) and campaigns playable on each account.

Message to the studio- Has finance and marketing provided a realistic forecast of what KS & Early Access customers would spend given what is provided to them in the bundles? Specifically, is there an expectation that in the short term enough customers will purchase the additional chapters after being slighted vs. providing the content and THEN selling additional content? Note, this family will not be making any more purchases from FS.

Almost forgot! Did you pull this out of early access to get ahead of the Dawn of War remaster coming out next week? If so, that was a poor choice and I would expect a huge player base to forget about you and leave you in obscurity.

I don't like leaving a review like this without any suggestions but I am lost for words...

""A great re-imagining of traditional Westwood and Blizzard style RTS. Game state is very good for an early access game. The campaign is compelling and interesting. I can recommend purchasing.""",1722560239,2024-08-01 20:57:19

BUT.
There is a long way to go yet.. things have improved, the Devs are getting better at telling us what and when to expect without over hyping, and they appear to be listening to feedback. 1v1 is great, 3VE is okay.

On that note! FG. My number 1 complaint about Stormgate is the Hotkeys: being stuck with the same grid for both the command card and the build cards is a HUUUGE problem in terms of playbility. I need Hold position to be H but this also means that building a barracks is H, building Doggos is H, Building Atlas is H, building those science vessel things that I really need to build more of is H... I'd also like my Mech to be D/E Siege/Unsiege, but I can't do that without messing up everything else. Please prioritize fixing this.

steam,171258249,"Been playing since Alpha 1. It's the most streamlined RTS I've ever seen. Macroing is much easier with the simplified commands, but players still use to hotkeying workers and buildings have that option too. Units are tankier so most don't die instantly if you look away. I love the variability between races too. All three races feel very distinct and their own unique experiences. 

It's not perfect. There are still a few bugs and glitches that need to be worked out. It is much improved since the alpha though (RIP OP Vanguard Turret). 

I recommend it for any RTS fan. Frost Giant is very interested in community feedback and have worked hard (and continue to work) to make this the best RTS it can be. I've loved being along for the ride and look forward to seeing where they can go with Stormgate.",1722558321,2024-08-01 20:25:21

steam,171257767,"This is Early Access, so things will change before the final game is released. 

Gameplay is solid, but the cutscenes are very rough right now.  Some of the worst I've seen in a game of this scale, very immersion breaking for the story.  Lips and mouths do not move at all, neither during cutscenes nor in pre mission briefing nor when heroes talk to you in mission, 

The worst problem is the pricing structure.  I thought that they were going to do what Starcraft 2 did and allow anyone to play any Coop Commander for free until level 5, then they'd have to buy them individually.   But no, you have buy them in packs right now to even unlock the Commanders.  Without knowing how they play or if they are even your style, you have to buy them.  

This alone will probably prevent at least 3 friends of mine from getting any part of this game, as they were really only excited for the Coop stuff (Coop Campaign is coming too, presumably before 1.0 but we don't know).  We were all really looking forward to this, and now that excitement is all gone.

I really enjoy the gameplay.  It feels great like Starcraft 2 but with some additional benefits that make gameplay easier and push the RTS genre forward a bit/increase accessibility to new RTS players (a bot to manage your economy for you, lots of tips and tutorials, being able to access all upgrades/units to build from anywhere on the map using hotkeys built into the game).

If you are here for PvP this may be for you.  Coop campaign is coming for 1.0 release but not right now.

I can only hope that they get their pricing structure sorted and the cutscenes fixed before the full launch.

Edit:  Ok so I was totally wrong and the Purchase button explains that yes, it is exactly like Starcraft 2 for Coop Commanders.  They are free to play until Level 5 then a $10 purchase in the game, real world money no in game currency first.  So I am changing my score to reflect that as that was a huge problem for me obviously.
Cutscenes still rough, still other problems but much more worth it for me.",1722557600,2024-08-01 20:13:20

If you are someone that likes to play PvE then I would recommend playing the Chapter Zero campaign missions before purchasing anything and seeing if the game lives up to your standards. So far, I am having a blast!",1722557465,2024-08-01 20:11:05
steam,171257561,"Right now, the answer is no. I wouldn't recommend this to other players. If there is improvement, maybe this will change. My main issue is optimization. The game looks, plays, and animates, like it came out in 2006. But the minimum specs you need hardware from 2016. I can play LoL on High Settings, DotA2 on High Settings, and SC2 on Extreme Graphics Quality. I can't even LAUNCH StormGate. I had to play it on my wife's PC since it's newer, she only got into PC gaming really after we met. Apart from the optimization, the campaign is awful. It's as if they designed the characters to be hated. I'm not a fan of the art style, but I was thinking this would be great as it could run on low hardware since it looked cartoony. Nope. But apart from the art style the personalities of the characters. All of them are entitled, you don't really get to know them, you just know that they are the best, they can do anything, they will always succeed, and they need to be respected, because they say so. And they are always right, and know how everything works, and if you don't know, you're the problem. I'm just really not a fan of this right now, and I'm really disappointed being a Kickstarter backer who backed the Ultimate Founder's Pack. If there are major personality or campaign overhaul, and major optimization is done where hardware reflective of the art direction can actually run the software, then I'll probably play more. But right now, in it's current state, this is a hard sign for everyone to stay away from this game. Even the controls and character mapping/movement is bad. I'd expect a bunch of melee units to react like zerglings and surround opponents, but instead they just all pile up behind another and I have to manually click each unit to have them properly surround an enemy. it's just so bad right now. It needs improvement. A $200 SC2 collectors edition gave me much more for my dollars than this has. This is worth a fraction of what I could purchase in the past. For $200 on any of the SC2: WoL/HotS/LotV (Total $650) collectors edition you had the games, on discs, with  fancy boxes, with phsyical CD sound tracks, with tons of artworks, and DVDs, a total 70 hour campaign that was a ROLLERCOASTER of emotion and AMAZING to look at. I got to live that 3 times, with 3 campaigns in SC2 + 1 DLC campaign. Right now, this is not the RTS, let alone product I am looking for. With better tools, and better productivity, getting what I had for $200 in 2010, should be more than possible. The costs of production are lower than ever before. I'm just really disappointed. I also wish I could run it on my PC rather than having to build a new one. Anyways, right now I got a digital game and maybe a statue on it's way in the mail for the $200, and the game is dead on arrival for me. I look forward to editing this review in the future. I really want to.",1722557298,2024-08-01 20:08:18
steam,171257228,"I am primarily interested in the 1v1 ladder play, which I have really enjoyed so far and can see some really exciting potential for the future as well. There are some innovative elements to the RTS game-play that I feel are great experiments. 

1. The global macro tools are something I have never seen in an RTS before and while it takes some getting used to if you have played a lot of RTS such as SC2, is a really cool addition that I think will make the game friendlier to new players. 
2. The unique production and enrichment mechanic of the 2nd resource (therium) is pretty interesting, allowing for more flexible openings than some other RTS games. 
3. Each of the factions feel pretty distinct and have interesting play-styles. 
4. I like the king-of-the-hill style control zones, which offer opportunities for risk/reward decisions throughout the game and encourage scrappy fights all across the battlefield. 

Overall, for players who are interested in the PvP elements of the game, I would recommend it. 

A few things I am looking forward to seeing added to the game: 
1. Better replay evaluation tools (overlays that show worker counts, resources lost, current production, etc.)

This needs another year of development and hopefully it maybe a bit better.

The biggest sins are the general readability of combat and units, the slow pacing and the antiquated animations.  For general readability, the units lack some definition and contrast, making them colored blobs.  I couldn't even tell a particular unit was flying for a while because the shadows are so soft it was hard to notice it was flying.  There is a lack of momentum and definition to a lot of the game.  This can be fixed, but it isn't good now.

The in-game animated scenes are a bit rough but passable, though this gets worse as a ton of stuff has bobbing portraits without even moving mouths.  It's 2024, you would think we could at least get bad generic mouth movements when characters are speaking?

Overall, right now, this just isn't doing anything for me.

I have been playing RTS genre games since I was a kid. I grew up with SC1 and SC Brood War. WC3 and SC2. I've played every Blizzard RTS. And to an extent you can almost feel it here. What you can't feel is the design, or game-play, or art, or narrative design of these Veterans that used to make these Awesome titles. Sound design is probably some of the worst out there. Visually speaking, the characters look like they just wiped out Tomato Town. But I'll break those down in their own segments. 

Game Design: 
Game Design feels like it's got the keybindings/playstyle of WC3 mixed with SC2. I like both of those genres of games so that's a win. What doesn't feel good is how dull and drab the actual fights are. I still remember the first time I had a pack of banelings run into a group of my marines. The fights just don't feel important. At all. 

Sound Design: The sound is...mute? It just doesn't feel good soundwise. I get nothing but a very quiet voiceline that can be overheard by classical music for gods sake. With both WC3 and SC2 They gave you both very noticeable and audible warnings of when a fight happened, or if your base was attacked. None of that is there. Weapons/Units/Game Sound is all very off. It does not have interesting voicelines (most of them rehashed from previous games or pop culture references), and weapons don't sound like weapons. Guns sound like Firecrackers for the humans. 

Visual Design: Well, next stop is Tilted Towers. No joke, the art for this game looks like it came from a mobile add. Either that or my step dad stopped by Dollar General to get me a Dollar Toy action figure. Cause holy hell models look plastic as hell. 

Other issues that are apparent the dev's aren't willing to discuss/voice opinions on:
Co-Op. Co-Op feels really bad. No interesting Missions or notable characters in Co-Op. The commanders are all behind a paywall (Being free to level 5 does not translate to free to play at all). The fact that people who paid up to the price for a full AAA game still don't get those Commanders is bad. When Legacy of the Void for SC2 came out with Co-Op, it gave the first 6 characters for free as well as Fenix for a limited time. It's 1 thing to charge F2P people for commanders, but another to charge those who bought the game. 

Finances: Dev's have been shady with their finances, and it's like pulling teeth to try and read their financial reports. 

TLDR: Do not buy. Play free or go back to WC3 and SC2. As of right now it's not even half baked.

steam,171251584,"I play RTS games since Dune 2. SG was promoted as the next, great ""Blizzard-style"" RTS. It's nothing like that. It feels like a postmodern mix of SC2 and WC3. The Vanguard faction is very similar to Terrans from SC2, but without its charm. For ex. the basic unit of the Vanguard, is the Lancer. It's a Space Marine with an axe. Really. It's a SPACE MARINE WITH AN AXE. I guess, they wanted to mix Space Marines with Grunts from WC3. That's their idea, for a new basic unit, a primitive mishmash of a Space Marine (SC2) and a Grunt (WC3). The main hero in the campaign is Amara, which basically looks like a female version of Gollum, with huge, bulging eyes, and huge palms. Ugly and boring as hell. She uses dual pistols, like Tracer from Overwatch. Her guns sound like, firecrackers. Unit rotations are almost instant, so everything feels like it's made from plastic. They also use some unit shaders, which makes everything look like it's made from plastic/clay, like some Chinese toy soliders. There is ZERO creativity in unit design, to such a degree that the Vanguard, have a flying unit, which exactly like Medivacs from SC2, to the point, that they use THE SAME VOICE LINES, delivered also by a woman. No, really, those voice lines, are not SIMILAR, they are THE SAME. They didn't even BOTHER, to design a few NEW lines of text. Combat sound effects feel very weak. All weapons feel weak. You have that impression, that you are looking at some toy soliders fighting, with their tiny ""pew, pew"" guns. This game has no redeeming factors. It's like a mockery of Blizzard's legacy. There is nothing ""next-gen"" about it, except some netcode tech, which doesn't matter to most people. Graphically, this game is MUCH worse than SC2. It gives me vibes similar to WC3: Reforged: a cheap crap, outsourced to China, to cut costs. They have the main UI similar to SC2, but they didn't bother make it look nice. It would take to much of their precious time, to make a few polished and nice looking panels. The story feels like it's written for 10yo boys. On top of that, it's some kind of postmodern, self-referential mix of story arcs from older Blizzard games. Maps are full of trees, because the same model, can be used over and over and over, to  cut costs. I doubt, that this game will ever be any good. Currently, there is absolutely no reason to play this. Stick to SC2, because this is not SC3 and it's not WC4. It's some kind of, RTS business venture, with zero inspiration, zero fresh ideas, zero production values and zero polish.",1722548447,2024-08-01 17:40:47

The campaign is okay but is rather short right now (6 missions).
The cinematics is quite rough at the moment, but from my understanding most of them are placeholders and will be updated later in the development. The devs could have made this more clear by for example putting a red cross over the screen during cinematics but it is what it is.
I did the missions on hard to make it somewhat challenging. beginner difficulty makes the missions way to fast imo.
After clearing a mission the brutal difficulty opens for that mission.

The co-op is pretty funny, have played a couple of times. will certainly play more of them.
Feels quite familiar if you have played sc2.

PvP is good. Gameplay feels very good but there are still a lot to improve and balance and a lot of features missing or are very basic at the moment.

Campaign, Co-Op and the rest never really mattered to me but I had fun playing them alone and then with friends. Art style is not important to me either but the cutesy modern-age style they chose is fine and the units are easily distinguishable. 

I haven't seen or heard of any connection or server issues and this is what one might expect but after AoE4 and TWW3s rocky releases I have come to appreciate this merit greatly.

Overall a complete success in my book. People will always have issues with art and not enough single player content etc. but this is all subject to change and improvement (and for me personally neither are issues).

First off, let’s address the elephant in the room: yes, it’s early access, and with that comes a few bumps in the road. There are some broken features and a few missing elements, but that’s to be expected at this stage. The developers have been transparent about this, and it’s clear they’re working hard to polish the game.

Now, onto the good stuff! The graphics are absolutely OK, unit response time feels right. The gameplay mechanics are innovative and keep you on your toes. The community is already buzzing with excitement, and it’s great to see such a passionate player base forming.

The potential for Stormgate is immense. With each update, the game is getting better and better. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for this gem. If you’re on the fence about jumping in, I’d say give it a shot. It’s a thrilling ride, and being part of its growth is a unique experience.

I strongly believe that the campaign should be removed from EA since it is too early in development.

UPDATE: I have changed my initial review removing some of the negative points since I had more time to experience the game now. Something that is totally my fault was that my computer was not working on performance mode, which was impacting the co-op gameplay. After I changed that I could have a much better experience with this game mode and had a lot of fun despite the points I mentioned regarding commands not being registered and unreliable path finding. Regarding the 1v1 I believe the game is definitely in the right direction and it is really fun to play and grind.

Campaign is not really appealing in terms of story and characters, but it's an improvement in technical aspects.
Gameplay's pacing is a bit slower, but I find that more enjoyable than 1-second long battles of starcraft. It's a bit weird with art style - units look good while characters are grotesque. Game supports ultra-wide screen and runs smoothly without consuming too much CPU/GPU.

The units are fun to attack with, and theres a variety of strategies to come up with from rushing to expanding. I think it could improve it's unit controls similar to that of BAR and age of empires with unit formations.  One example from BAR(Beyond all resaon) is holding right click to make custom formations, concave, convex, trench formations, very helpful. I think units should all be able to attack ground, and should especially air units should have loitering options similar to BAR. I think some things are a little too similar to starcraft, literally using the same quotes and mannerisms.  but they could make changes still.  I think the games' engine is a healthy balance between starcraft and warcraft 3.  Units do not die too fast, or too slow, it is a correct balance.  I think users should be able to zoom out more like warcraft 3 can.  And even like Beyond All Reason.  I think there should be different types of abilities and tricks to add in such as Shield generators, Nuclear missiles, things like this.

* The game does not look very good, to me screenshots look a lot better than my experience with the campaign.
* The gameplay is not smooth and after playing just part of the first campaign mission, I was so indifferent I rather went to write this review.
* The game systems feel very old, not next gen. Core things would need to change for this to actually feel like the next gen RTS, at least in the campaign.

So I played through the Vanguard campaign and I'd say overall it was a fun experience that I enjoyed and want to play through again mostly for the missions and getting achievements. The missions were the most polished part and they were fun thought they could have been a little bit harder on brutal difficulty. 

When it comes to stuff outside of the missions it seems more work could be done there. For example the hub where you spend your time is a great addition and really like the idea but there could be so much more stuff to do and progress be shown. The whole ship stayed more or less the same through the campaign. 

Dialogue and story were the weak points for me. When characters are speaking to each other it's more of an information dump and some of the dialogue is just janky. Characters were fine for the most part and a standout character arc for me was the A.I bot TRIP.  I liked the story even though it wasn't anything mind blowing. I felt that the story jumped a lot and the world building needs more work. I ques I would have liked more in game cinematics or something like that. or even text books/audio recordings that can be found in the map.  

Progress systems were ok when it comes to unit upgrades and artifact research. Also there were items for heroes and I'm a big fan of items in RTS like in WC3 but here they didn't feel so special or impactful outside of summoning extra units and some adrenaline boosts. The passive and aura items were just there and I just spread those items kinda evenly between my heroes. 

Great progress has been made in a year and I would still recommend people to try out the game since there is a good amount of free content :)

Early Acces launch review

After a long wait and fun beta phases I am once again enjoying 1v1 ladder. The game plays really well and unit movement is really fluid (mostly). The only unit I have had problems with is weaver. They seem to be clunky when they are around sim cities and in middle of armies. 

Played few rounds of co-op as well and it was really fun.

Campaign seems like the most unfinished part of the game when comparing 1v1, co-op and campaign. Cinematics and characters don't seem to be anything special  when I compared them to wc2, wc3 or sc2. I skipped the dialogue and cinematics since they are really rough and uninteresting. I want to experience them when they are ""finished"" someday in the future so when it comes to campaign I only focused on gameplay and it's kinda 6/10.

Looking forwards to the future of Stormgate and all of the other RTS games that are in developement. It's a great time to be a RTS fan :)",1722531352,2024-08-01 12:55:52

- Celestials need to be scrapped and completely reworked. The idea behind it is cool but the execution is entirely overpowered. 
- Vanguards cant just make Tier 1 units and march over to the opponents base and stutter step them to death... also needs to be reworked. I can just make 10 Exos and you will not win, because u dont have any splash damage to defend. 
- Infernals, by far the coolest and most interesting race, however, the units are WAY too squishy. you will have NO chance against a stutter-step from vanguards, also will you have no chance against Cells that just canon rush you because you have nothing thats remotely strong enough in tier1, and even Tier2 units are MUCH too slow, with nothing to slow the enemy down you will DIE.

- The game does not look good, either in game or the cut scenes.   In pretty much every way the 14 year old SC 2 looks MUCH better.  In fact Stormgate is FAR closer to the 20+ year old WCIII in appearance.
- It plays a bit choppy.  Again, the decade+ old SC2 was a far smother game to play.
- The game play itself is much more reminiscent of WCIII (up to a story that appears to be highly derivative of the story in WCIII.)  Even the hero loot system is like that in WCIII
- The units are not particularly interesting.

The devs may fix the game and the additional content may make it more interesting in the future but I really cannot recommend this game right now.  It is absolutely not the next generation of RTS.  In fact it appears to have dropped back a couple of generations.  If you want to play a much better version of this game, then I recommend that you get the WCIII remaster from Blizz and just play that.  It is a better game despite being over 20 years old.  If you want a better game, replay SCII.

steam,171235282,"Played 1v1 heavily in Elephant phase beta test Feb/March 2024. Played first 3 tutorial campaign missions just now. 

Game plays smoothly, unit control is great. Very unique feel to all units, heavily enjoying the design of the units and races.

Campaign missions were fun, level design is promising. I enjoyed the missions and will be purchasing missions 4,5, and 6 shortly.

The game has evolved a lot during the last 6 months. Polish is being applied quickly, updates are frequent.

Game is absolutely unfinished, lots of polish missing from all areas. However this is not unexpected. Game is in early access and I am judging it as an unfinished, work in progress product.

My only complaint is I feel some of the characters in the campaign are lacking in writing ways which make it hard to relate/connect with them. Any story in media needs to have the consumer loving/hating/invested in the characters. At the moment I think some of the lines are a little cheesy from Amara and I feel she's somewhat lacking a distinct personality.

Contrasting that, I enjoyed Maloc and Warz. Although their screen time brief, left a much stronger impression on me. Maloc is irritable and Warz is more collected and stoic. Whether good or bad, the way Maloc and Warz were portrayed has left a stronger impression on me than Amara and Blockade. Seeing as Amara (and somewhat Blockade) is the face of the Stormgate campaign introduction, I believe they need changes that leave stronger impressions on the player. Good or bad. They're currently too bland and uninteresting.

Outside the game, the devs communicate regularly regarding updates and direction. It's extremely clear what their plans are, what to expect in the future, and what you're purchasing.

My final comments would be, if you want a finished, polished product, the game in it's current state is not for you. Come back at 1.0 release. Stormgate is in early access, unfinished, and needing a lot of polish in all areas. The devs have clearly communicated as much, and are under no impression that this game is ""ready"" or finished. Having said this, the roots are strong, the core gameplay is fun and engaging, and I'm excited to see the game develop into a stronger version as time goes on.",1722529070,2024-08-01 12:17:50

steam,171234324,"Maaaan, as a longtime Starcraft 2 fan, I was so stoked for this game. But I think the aesthetic is a dealbreaker for me. It looks like a worse Valorant, and unfortunately this makes the gameplay just feel bad.

It's a huge shame that the devs committed to such a horrible art style. I see this being irreparable damage that can only be fixed by a huge overhaul. And with the game being as unfinished as it is, I'm sure this aesthetic has already been committed to. I can't possibly look forward to any positive change when the game looks this bad.

I really, really hated the campaign missions, and again, the character models look garbage. 

I could see the PvP mode being competitive, but currently it's just not fun to play. Unit movement, responsiveness, attack animations, and even death animations are clunky and unpleasant. Microing big armies seems to lack that finesse that Starcraft had. And (again a design flaw) the UI is damn ugly.

Honestly, I'm just shocked! With such a powerhouse dev team, how could they drop the ball? I'm guessing they got a new art team or something of that nature.

Anyway, currently, I cannot recommend this game in good faith. It's really sad, too, because I've been jonesing for a new excellent RTS. Guess I gotta wait for Battle Aces.",1722527944,2024-08-01 11:59:04

steam,171233666,"I've maybe left one review on one other game and this is the 3rd edit on this one after a lot more play time... Because I really cared about this game and still hope it does well.

I'm sticking by not changing my review to positive without major changes to monetization. Gaming should be affordable, everyone should be able to play the entirety of a game for a reasonable price. If your overhead is that expensive, you shouldn't be making games (250K salaries). 

Sc2 cost about 60$ at launch, for a full game. This included everything. People paid reasonable money and then got a good campaign, pvp, and eventually coop experience. I paid 60$ for stormgate and had a 10$ micro transaction hero and a 5$ rat skin waiting for me on day 1. Feels really bad. Also, if I even want to find out about the rest of the campaign (which I would like to play), will I need to fork over $30 more dollars? So now I'm paying $90 for still just fractions of a game? Also, that is just the campaign for one race? For 60$ I think I got about 1/10 or less of the game I got 10 years ago with Sc2.

I just bought a 60$ game, Baulder's Gate 3 and it was game of the year. Had everything it in and always will have everything in it. It will also never tempt me to buy more using some fomo tactics.

Be creative with your monetization. Make in game incentives for players to earn discounts on heroes in coop. Make winning one campaign on brutal give a 50% discount on the next campaign. 

Or how about just lower your prices and stop being greedy? I don't believe a game should cost $300 - $400 dollars to own all the content, and I'm pretty sure this will end up in that range. 

Same old blizzard/activision.

That being said, I've been enjoying the coop. It's nothing special, but brings back the nostalgia of sc2 for me. I agree most people coming to the genre would be better off just playing sc2, so much more content for so much less money. Also better content.

Right now, it's just hard to say good things about the game. I think the feel of the game is decent in pvp and I think it will get better.

But fix your monetization strategy. It's like your asking me to buy a car built in 2016 instead of one made in 2024, but pay 3-4 times what most cars in 2024 cost, or just own parts of the car. Like, ""Hey man, what are you complaining about? The steering wheel is free and so is the axis and wheels, but if you want some seats, windshield, or a roof... we need extra $$$"" I think the engine is included?",1722527257,2024-08-01 11:47:37

The 1v1 multiplayer is really good.  Fun gameplay and not as frustrating as SC2 so far. A little bit slower paced but not by much. Does not feel slow when playing but feels like you have more time to react to stuff happening. 

The campaign is alright, still lots of stuff needs work (cinematics, voice acting), and some missing stuff (rough textures, some missions without music). The campaign lacks polish for now, but since it is early access it's ok for now. The gameplay is promising and the later missions are fun.

A considerable amount of the negative reviews are complaining about total non-issues.
People who paid for Kickstarter bundles that list every individual item they were getting being upset that they didn't receive content that wasn't part of that list, people saying a F2P game should not produce any monetised content for 6-12 months (this was a real opinion) just so they don't feel butthurt because they bought an expensive kickstarter bundle (that included physical merch) and didn't get every piece of in-game content.

The Co-op mode is quite enjoyable, a decent variety of maps for this stage of development, though the XP curve is atm way too slow (will update if this changes because it's a very common complaint).
Campaign cutscenes look very, very rough and the voice acting is unremarkable (Amara especially whose model does not look good up close), but the gameplay is fairly solid and thought clearly went into adding incentives to explore the map, with side-quests and hidden items.
Ladder atm seems quite rough with one faction overwhelmingly dominating, this issue is on FG's radar, we'll see how quick they are to fix it.",1722526066,2024-08-01 11:27:46

steam,171227423,"If you've never played an RTS before, Stormgate is not a bad place to start! I would say this is the most casual-friendly StarCraft-style RTS that I have played! As of writing this, I've played in the Open Beta and now the Ultimate Early Access; I've seen what this game has to offer and, it's a blast! 

The campaign is short; only 6 mission so far, with more to come. For experienced RTS players it might take an hour tops. But for new players I'd say there's a solid 2-3 hours of content depending on how strong your mechanics are; and you can always replay the missions if you want to improve your par-time. The actual campaign game play is a lot of fun and the cut scenes are fun. This feels like a WarCraft-esque campaign, with StarCraft-esque units and responsiveness.

The 1v1 during Open Beta was pretty cutthroat, and I'm honestly expecting the same thing here because it's still the same people playing. I would say if you're new, maybe try the 1v1 last, after you have a good feel for your preferred faction. Haven't played 1v1 yet, and I'm not in a hurry to.

Where Stormgate shined in the Open Beta, IMHO, was in Co-Op Mode! And with the Ultimate Early Access it only shines more with the addition of new commanders, a new faction, and at least one new map post-Beta (I've only played like 3 Co-Op games as of this review and have seen 2 total maps.) This is a fun, objective-focused mode where you can power up your commander, explore the different factions, and get acquainted with Stormgate's unique quick-macro mechanics! Truly is a blast to keep queuing up mission after mission!

As a long-time StarCraft casual, I think this Early Access offering of Stormgate is a fun casual-friendly, party-style RTS! And it will only get better as we get closer and closer to the full release! The game has a lot to offer already and is worth checking out!",1722520284,2024-08-01 09:51:24

steam,171227275,"Giving this a recommendation because I enjoy the 1v1 and 3vE I mainly came for and I believe in the overall project. That said, I would tell most people to wait till Aug 13, play the free content available (which there is a solid amount of IMO), and buy the parts you are interested in piecemeal. 

1v1 feels good. The factions have evolved a fair bit since the open beta, and each one feels incredibly distinct from each other. The matches have a nice flow to them, and with the exception of spellcasters, I like how the units are defined more by their positioning, attack and movement patters and passive abilities. Deathballing is fine, but suboptimal, and whatever micro you feel like you can put in has nice payoffs. It feels a lot less volatile and more textured than a lot of the fights in SC2, where sheer density of damage and taking a good initial engagement were most of the determining factors once armies got big. I also like how FG played with some more outlandish ideas that feel like they should be imbalanced, but somehow feel fine here. Finally, the mode is completely F2P. Other than some cosmetic stuff, you get everything needed for 1v1 at no cost, and there is nothing you can pay for that will give you an advantage.

3vE Co-op has improved quite a bit since the open beta. There are more missions and their designs are a substantial step up. All heroes are available for free to be leveled up to 5, paying $10 for one of them uncaps their level to 10, and then there are further levels to augment them (this cap will be raised later according to the devs). From SC2, I found co-op had enough replay-ability to make it easily feel worth it to buy the characters you like and get your moneys worth several times over. I don't see why SG will feel different, but it is also early. I am currently testing Warz, who I have not bought, so I will see how it feels to play him capped at level 5.

That said, I get why some people feel burned by buying a large pack, especially if their interest is in the campaign. The campaign missions are fine, but not polished or interesting enough to be worth buying piece meal at the moment. The presentation in cutscenes looks awful for the price. I've only played part of the First 3 missions (which are available to everyone for free), and if I did not have a bundle from the kickstarter, I would not pay for the followup chapters until I saw significant improvements. The fact that the bundle sizes basically means some people payed 20, 40, or even 60 bucks to get access to a slice of a WIP campaign. Yeah, it's going to suck. am aware that this is a work in progress and the game is being iterated on. Right now, the reaction is saying that this iteration did not feel worth the cost for a lot of people. 

Finally, there are highs and lows to the game's performance. It is definitely not optimized right now, and the performance has fluctuated between the different builds. This is to be expected for EA, but I've found this build has a tenancy to ""sieze up"" once per map, causing units to be unresponsive for a few seconds before returning to normal. This has been a lot more frequent in Co-op. The art style isn't everyone's thing, frankly I like the unit designs in a vacuum. The visual details and lighting have been improved SIGNIFICANTLY since the open beta, which does help everything mesh together more and feel less cheap. Seeing the improvement in this area alleviates a lot of my worries about how the game will look come 1.0. Finally, the snowplay engine feels very crisp to control. Units feels extremely responsive when it works. There are still times where the pathing derps out, but this is also an area the devs have said they expect to be refining for as long as it needs polish. 

IMO, this game's biggest failure, despite good intentions, was that it was launched with this kind of bundled pricing. It meant a lot of people payed full price without knowing the game was a WIP, when there was no reason they shouldn't have waited for Aug 13, and sampled the freely available content before deciding what parts they want to buy. The model of ""free to play the core game, buy the bits of content that you enjoy, and see everything in the game improve overtime"" is a solid model with good potential in my opinion, but the early access bundles made people feel like they payed full price for a 6 mission beta build with other features that they may not care about.

TL;DR - Fun 1v1 and Co-Op, campaign needs a lot of work to feel worth the money. Wait for Aug 13, play a bit of everything for free, and then see if you want to buy anything.",1722520110,2024-08-01 09:48:30

steam,171224562,"The good:
- 1v1 actually feels quite nice. All three factions already feel nice to play and have unique features. The celestials are especially unique. Units are responsive. Ladder and matchmaking work great. Lots of SC2 vibes in a good way.
- Coop is also quite nice. The faction's units are heavily modified depending on the hero you pick. Each hero is fun to play.
- Music is excellent,

The bad:
- The campaign is simply nowhere near finished. I think it was a huge mistake to release it now. On paper, the idea is great: SC2 like missions with a variety of objectives, cutscenes between missions, and heroes. However, the hero's 3D model during cutscenes look horrendous, sound effects are all over the place, some of the mission objectives are uninteresting, not possible to save the current game.
- Performance is still an issue: big frame drops in late game 1v1 and co-op even on cutting-edge hardware, still some significant pathing issues, some units get stuck when inside big clumps of units.

Conclusion:
The game has good potential. Its current state is more like an early beta, not the level of polish I would expect for release (even in early access). It is already enjoyable to play in 1v1.

I recommend the current version of the game. The core 1v1 is fun and it's free! The other modes show promise for the future, and I recommend people buy campaign and co-op heroes to help support development. 

I do have my complaints however. I'm slightly annoyed with how everything released, but completely understand the developers need more funding. I just would have preferred they stay in early access and just do a marketing push for the finished campaign mode. 

1) Most of us don't play RTS for the campaign, nobody asked for this. It makes this a weak launch. To boot my 52$ delux edition didn't even come with the campaign, I have to pay another 25$ which makes it more costly than the ultimate edition which DOES have the campaign. Way to make me buy the game twice...
2) 1v1 isn't actually fully finished. Tier 3 units are missing, balance is wacky, and Celestials are still in Alpha prototype phase.
3) They didn't even update co-op to at least use the most recent build. The units and game play are from like a year ago. Its one of your only monetization sources, at least update it if you are charging for it....
4) No 2v2 ladder mode. My most played mode in Starcraft 2 was 2v2 Ladder. We cannot invite our friends to play if there are no modes to play together...

All that being said. I think this is a very sad and weak way to launch out of early access. Trying to draw everyone back in with a campaign mode that nobody wanted isn't going to turn things around. Would have been much better to AT LEAST get co-op working first. Most people just want to play an RTS with thier buddies and there are no multiplayer modes on release.....

Portraits and characters are not moving when they are speaking. Thats a big low point for me, I know I should not care, but hey I do.

The characters when selected and they speak on the menu bar, 0 animation, like c'mon, it was animated since SC.

Not to mention when I click on said portrait, I dont jump to the character, unit

Voiceacting: I am unsure if something went wrong, but it falls flat for me, I want to be really into this world, but gravitas was not there.

After playing my thought was:
I hope this game can turn around as No Mans Sky as seeing where are we currently, you guys will be hit and hit hard. It will be working against the wind for a couple of months if not for a full half year. I might play the Campagin, but I am def pinning this game in my ""lets check back in a half years time"".

My constant thought during the mission was, jesus I need to play SC: Remastered to wash this down.
I am not mad, angry just eternally disappointed. Best of luck to all",1722505247,2024-08-01 05:40:47

steam,171214038,"[b]Full Release Review:[/b]
Oh a lot has happened since last we spoke!  Release day is here.  Another day, another shaft to the customer!  I guess we'll go in order of the original review.

For those of us that supported the game on Kickstarter, Frost Giant lied about the content we would receive.  These are the exact words that used to be on the Kickstarter.  ""You can receive all of our Year Zero Heroes in the Founder's Pack.""  What is Year Zero I hear you ask, so I give you another exact quote.  ""Year Zero is what we're calling our Early Access period.""  Early Access just ended today with the full release.  Do we have all heroes?  No we do not.  We are missing two heroes, Ryker and Warz.  Both are on sale right now for the low price of $8.49 each, normal price $9.99.  No worries, they ninja edited the Kickstarter later as to not give us what was promised.

On full release, they put a new Ultimate bundle on the store that does include everything the Founders were missing.  It is impossible for Founders to upgrade to this bundle.  The cheapest option would be to buy both heroes individually.  It feels like we, the most loyal customers, are being punished for supporting the game and the company early.  Most companies would reward the people that supported them early.  Frost Giant thinks because we backed early, we'll just continue to give them money and say nothing about it.  Frost Giant is the person trying to lure you into a dark alley.  They don't deserve your support.

The next Frost Giant lie, they told us the game was funded until release.  They later changed that claim and said they only meant until Early Access release.  Today they released the game with patch 0.6, well before the patch 1.0 a full release should be.  They had to release into Early Access far earlier than they should have to make more money, they're out of money now and have to do the full release again before it's ready.  This company couldn't make a good choice if it was the only choice they had.

After the Kickstarter drama, Frost Giant developers, including the CEO, were caught faking Steam reviews.  They got caught, changed their names, got caught again, tried to gaslight the community, then made excuses saying all of the devs did it personally and it wasn't a coordinated effort, then said those developers (yes still including the CEO), were simply poorly informed.  The evidence of this is online and the community director admitted to it.

In that same vein, they were caught making fake Reddit hype posts as well.  I suppose not as serious as the Steam reviews where they were pretending to be random players of the game.  The company is an embarrassment.  It's lies, backtracking, ninja edits, misinformation, and unethical business practices

Oh and the game still isn't very good.  It's a lot better yes, but it's still a no from me.  Don't support this game.  Don't support these developers.  Maybe their failure here will teach them to be honest.

[b]Early Access Review:[/b]
You can take the developer out of Blizzard, but you can't take Blizzard out of the developer.

Many of us supported this game because we wanted to see it succeed.  A lot of us are hundreds of dollars deep into this game already.  Why are there pre-day 1 microtransactions that we don't own?  Was my $360 not enough?  Now I need to be nickel and dimed with additional paid content on the first day of early access?  It feels like a slap in the face that there is content in the game I don't own, literally before the game has even released.

The campaign is terrible.  We're paying at least $5 per mission.  It's almost like this is a meta commentary on people caring too much about the campaign so they purposely made it as horrible as they could.  Maybe this is genius.  The writing, the artstyle, this game isn't winning in any category.  I have the graphics maxed out, the mouths don't move during cutscenes.

The co-op is half baked at best.  I'm surprised at just how often Stormgate is falling flat on it's face when not only did these developers work on successful projects, they can just copy what they did before.  You've done this already!  You should know what to do!

It seems they've also forgotten one factor that made WarCraft 3 and StarCraft 2 so successful.  The custom maps made by the community are wildly popular with a wide range of players.  Are the map tools available?  Of course not!  This should have been a huge focus on getting out.  Release the map tools to the community.  Allow them to patch up the holes in this abysmal product.  While you work out more trash campaign missions, the community could be keeping everything alive with custom games.

This is what I imagine a F2P version of WC3 would be like in 2003.  Unfortunately for Frost Giant, it's no longer 2003.  It's 2024 and this game is insulting.  The graphics suck, the art style sucks, this game is behind on every metric I can think of.  I paid so you don't have too.  Avoid this product.

On the plus side, that Collector's Edition I paid for might be worth some money one day.  ""Remember when those ex-Blizzard devs tried to start their own company and fell flat on their face?""",1722501714,2024-08-01 04:41:54

steam,171212588,"Updated with the 0.4.0 update:

Singleplayer is a considerably better experience now, and I would recommend people at least trying it to see if they like it -- the free missions that is.  As for spending money on Campaign, I'd still recommend waiting until 1.0.

The game is lots of fun, but is very much an Early Access title.  Strongly suggest you approach it as such.  This game is not intended to be your ""main title"" to grind or play yet.  1v1 is a lot of fun, but the ladder pool of players is quite small (~1,000 people), so don't expect a super engaging competitive scene outside of the top 100 players or so.

COOP has been put on the back-burner for a bit, so while it is fun to mess around with, I also do not recommend spending any money on heroes.  Heroes are free up to level 5, and that can be enough to mess around and enjoy testing this mode for now with two friends -- but also take everything with a grain of salt as this mode will see heavy updates in the next ~3-6 months.

Overall the game is on the right trajectory, but is still in development.  If playing a game in development is not your thing, just keep it on your wish-list and check back in the future.  There is absolutely something special here.

Finally, there is basically zero reason to spend money on the title right now outside of supporting the developers, as all the ""paid content"" is either notably unfinished or not even available yet (remainder of Vanguard missions etc...).  The free-to-play portion of the game is quite fun for testing out, and worth checking in each patch to see how it is improving.  Consider spending money to be something more akin to pre-ordering.",1722499355,2024-08-01 04:02:35
steam,171212246,"[[[Release Version Review]]]

I can't believe it's been a year since EA. The visual changes made to the game is going in the right direction. The Infernals look demonic and not cartoonish, and the main human characters no longer look like Eldricth horror monsters.

The game itself is well made. Macroing with just your left hand on the keyboard feels like second nature. There's no need to add your production structures to control groups as you can build/train units from one panel with a shared rally point. Kudos for the devs for making an RTS that is intuitive and a pleasure to play. Unfortunately, I won't be playing more because of the lack of content.

Before the esports success of Starcraft BW, RTS' were built with fun single player campaign first, competitive multiplayer and balance patches second. I'll echo what others have said before that RTS devs should return to that mindset so that they can attract a playerbase that is willing to go through the learning process from the amount of single player and casual multiplayer content which will ease their jump into competitive.

The problem is, they've focused so much on the sweaty hard core playerbase that co-op is still in development even at release. Yes, skirmish and competitive is free but despite that the amount of players is lacking. There's so many RTS games with a more stable balance and playerbase, why not play those instead?

About the Vanguard campaign, it's hard not to compare it with SC2's WoL campaign. In WoL almost every mission is tailor crafted to emphasize the use of the newly introduced unit but in Stormgate's? I feel like I'm just adding new units to a pile. Then there is this issue with pricing.  The price just for three single player missions is too steep. I think it's better to have a complete faction campaign bundle. Although honestly, I'd rather spend money buying heroes in co-op but alas.

Let his game be a lesson to others: you have to attract a large playerbase first before you cater to the smaller hardcore players. Otherwise, you'll only have 1k peak players at release. I wish EA was launched in this state to avoid bad first impressions but what's done is done.

[[[Early Access Review Posted: 1 Aug, 2024 @ 3:53pm]]]

I can tolerate the nightmare inducing faces that represent a human's, a rehashed Warcraft III campaign (but instead of Arthas getting a cursed sword Amara gets a fidget spinner), and Celestials dominating the ladder. The straw that broke the camel's back: I a-moved my scout (Vanguard dog unit) to kill an Imp (Infernal worker) and instead of attacking, it just floated while trying to bite a fleeing unit. That and you literally have an ad for ""GearUp Booster"" in the game's description (as of writing).

I feel like I've been scammed. No wonder the genre is dying. Thanks for driving one more nail in the coffin, Frost Giant.",1722498822,2024-08-01 03:53:42
steam,171212073,"Calling this next generation real-time strategy game a joke is an understatement. I had high hopes for it, considering that most real-time strategy fans are eagerly anticipating a new game in the genre. However, I am thoroughly disappointed as I fail to see any potential in this game. It has missed numerous opportunities since its inception. It appears to be a lazy imitation, comprising 80% Starcraft and 20% Warcraft, devoid of any innovative features. Where should I even begin to express my dissatisfaction? The graphics are abysmal, adopting a cartoonish art style that seems to cater to a younger audience (perhaps those who enjoy games like Fortnite and Overwatch with a similar art style). This is despite the game being marketed as designed for hardcore real-time strategy fans. To be frank, I doubt it would ever appeal to Generation Z or Generation Alpha, even if the game were exceptional, which it is not. Furthermore, even if I were to overlook the art style, the visual quality is subpar, falling short of Starcraft II, a game released over a decade ago. The three factions in the game are mere replicas of Terran, Zerg, and Protoss, albeit inferior versions. The user interface is a poor imitation of Starcraft II, and the gameplay is essentially the same but of lower quality. I cannot identify a single aspect in which this game surpasses or even matches Starcraft, despite being released in 2024. Capmaign - yes, I am quite confident that artificial intelligence nowadays has the capability to produce significantly more intriguing and distinctive storylines within just a few minutes nowdays. Yes, it is in early access, but while some games have been salvaged from a similarly dire state, I am highly skeptical that this game will succeed. It is quite probable that it may never see the light of a full release. Let us return to playing Starcraft II and hope for a revival of this fading genre.

In a lot of interviews and video they always talk about ''bringing the blizzard quality'' to the game, when really blizzard hasn't even been doing good lately. I was hoping for a game that would feel like a ''brand new RTS'' because god knows we've been wanting one for a while, but It just feels like starcraft2 all over again with close to zero improvement or new features. They tried a different approach with celestial armada and I did enjoy that, but vanguard and infernal feels extremely unoriginal.

for example, I didn't really like Age of empire 4, but the way they tried to makes civilisation feels much different with their passives, tree and all compared to aoe2 was actually a really good thing.

I look at vanguard, I see Terran
I look at infernal, I see Zerg
I look at celestial, I see Protoss

I which I could look at them and see vanguard internal and celestials, but they feel and play so much of the same that it just doesn't feel like a new experience. Celestial do feel different for a few things, so that's good.

steam,171211215,"I had to update my review of this because honestly I gave FG a real chance and I respect that there are people out there that want to give RTS fans what Blizzard refuses to do with Starcraft these days, but the problem is FG went about it wrong.

SC was so wildly successful because it was first and foremost a great game that had a dedicated fanbase because it was a solid experience on many different levels. The bones were good, much like Stormgate. The campaign was good with engaging characters and the multiplayer was top notch because it had modes to appeal to competitive players and casuals with things like the arcade modes. Because of these things, the game naturally grew a fanbase from all different types of gamers that enjoyed every aspect it had to offer, even if they weren't initially interested in it. Where SG differs from Starcraft is this insane astroturfing attempt at making this game esports before a fanbase is even established for it. Essentially FG attempted to run before they even had a chance to learn to crawl. This coupled with nothing this game offers is really that different from SC2 makes people quite often wonder why they don't just play SC2. Which is free.

I really wanted this game to succeed and I truly believed it could have if it was handled better. There still might be a chance for it to, they've finally realized their initial artstyle wasn't very good months later and are remedying it, but at this point I personally just do not care anymore. I might reinstall it whenever the rest of the campaign comes out because I've already payed for it, but I can't see myself reinstalling it until then.",1722497189,2024-08-01 03:26:29

So far, I don't find myself wanting to go back to other games that have been out for ages like Starcraft 2.

There is just absolutely nothing currently about the game that I think is actually great. The art style? Horrible, the pathing? Ok at the moment but way worse than people make it out to be. The audio is horrendous. The unit design feels boring and uninspired, most of the time the units feel like a neutered version of another rts unit.

As an early backer of Stormgate through Kickstarter and a proud owner of the Frost Giant Studios plushie, I have been eagerly following this game’s development. From participating in the beta to engaging with the community on their Discord and watching streams whenever possible, I’ve seen firsthand how much Stormgate has evolved since its initial announcement.

While the game in Early Access has its minor bumps, I have no doubt that Stormgate will continue to grow and improve. Frost Giant Studios has shown a genuine commitment to listening to feedback, not just from the players but from the entire RTS community, which is a huge plus in my book.

I’ve  enjoyed playing 1v1 matches, both against bots to practice and against other players. Each of the three factions offers something unique, catering to different playstyles and preferences. Although I have yet to secure a win against other players, the enjoyment I get from the game far outweighs the outcomes of the matches.

I believe in Frost Giant Studios and I wholeheartedly believe in Stormgate. With time and constructive feedback regarding our experiences and the bugs we encounter, the developers can make the necessary changes and improvements. It’s essential that we communicate precisely what we want to see in the game.

steam,171207024,"This game just sucks.
The UI is very primitive, the campaign writing is rough as hell and many of the cutscenes use in game models (warcraft 3 in-map dialogue cutscenes.) Which is fine if they're telling a story worth telling, not padding for time and referencing StarCraft on unit responses in a pretty corny way. It's cute as a reference, but the comparison just ends up reminding me of how much the two games have in common. Given how heavily inspired they obviously were by the game, though, it's so weird that everything feels so rough, like they saw that game's success and didn't understand the design of it well enough to get why any of the design decisions made in StarCraft 2 were made.

Which is weird because someone who worked on SC2 is developing this game. He's in one of the Steam store page videos, even.

Here's some examples of the pretty lackluster game design:
 - Unlike just about any RTS I've played, the minimap does NOT show the units in your selection differently than the rest of them. That means if you're looking at the minimap to see what units you're controlling at the moment, you can't. This is contrary to behavior that's been standard in most RTS games since at LEAST Warcraft 2, where your selected units show up as white on the minimap, while the rest of your units are your player color (blue player, blue minimap icons,) or bright green in StarCraft 1.
 - There *is* an idle worker select button, but it doesn't zoom you to the unit when you select it and there's no key to do so that I found. That means you can select an idle worker, but you won't know where that unit is standing, which means you don't know if it's on the opposite side of the map from where your camera is, or just barely off screen.
 - Most of the control points - one of the main features differentiating this game from StarCraft 2 -  just won't matter. Outside of the one that grants vision, they just don't provide much strategic value to be worth the time and unit damage taken.
 - The visual design for everything but the celestials is just ... bland. Uninteresting. Somewhat incohesive. They're also clearly just close siblings to the visual designs of Terran, Protoss and Zerg of StarCraft. The units themselves do have different functions than their Blizzard RTS counterparts, so it's not a straight copycat as far as game design goes. But it all just feels very lazy. Humans are focused on strong structures and defensive units and play, just like Terrans. Infernals have a creep mechanic that's uninspiring at best compared to Zerg creep in either StarCraft game. The Celestial Armada has Protoss Zealots, and I'll admit I didn't play with them much because I didn't want to spend too much time on a game I wasn't enjoying, but they're probably similarly based around air superiority just like Protoss are.

Somehow a youtube video made this game look good, but the actual gameplay is rough as hell and the UI is a mess, both in a match and in the menus outside of gameplay.

None of the game itself really seems to click together yet, either. It really just feels like a lackluster StarCraft 2 clone. How someone who was involved in the development of StarCraft 2 could fail to understand certain design fundamentals is bewildering to me. This game is clearly not ready for full early access in its current state.",1722490251,2024-08-01 01:30:51

I love SC2 but aspects of the 1v1 are just so brutal and nerve wracking. Stormgate can still get me to that place of frustration but the way the game is designed I feel it is much more satisfying. 

My best example is putting down the first supply building in SC2 can feel like this anxiety laden experience. In Stormgate the first supply building is not the very first thing you worry about. I think that alone speaks to the kind of care and concern for the player experience that the devs have. Sure there are plenty of bad reviews but in my experience the game has very high quality fundamentals, all the small details will get sorted out over time.

I appreciate the hotkey update, but setting it up is a nightmare. You have to rebind keys for every unit, which turns into a huge time sink. I ended up too lazy to finish because it just wasn’t worth the hassle.",1722486523,2024-08-01 00:28:43

They kind of missed the mark on this early launch. Let them cook and come back to it in a few year, when it's out of EA.

steam,171203898,"Quality:
I think the expression goes something like, ""A game is only late until it ships, but it's bad forever.""  Well with modern game development, it doesn't have to be bad forever.  Right now the single player experience feels like discount WC3 not a successor to SC2.  While I don't expect a perfect product in ""Early Access"", I doubt they are currently planning on coming back to these initial missions and improving the production value.  I hope that changes.  But as the missions are right now, they feel like recycled versions of old content.  Not better versions, but off brand versions.  If you've played the Blizzard franchises, the whole campaign will be familiar.  Without getting too specific, Amara is basically a combination of Arthas chasing Frostmourne and Zeratul's skill set.  The Infernals are Zerg mixed Diablo demons while the Celestials are Protoss mixed with Diablo Angels.  The Scavengers are basically the orcs in WC3 trying to summon the burning legion. You've got the hold out for evac mission, the temple exploration, and the newer point capture maps.  All that at a 50% mark up compared to the OG games.  And the cutscenes are not great.  Granted that's not where I would want them to focus, but I feel it needs to be said that they aren't really adding much to the value proposition.

Monetization:
The biggest problem I have right now is their monetization plan.  They need to knock down the price of mission packs to $2 a mission assuming they're planning on improving them from their current state.  If they plan on releasing the rest of the campaign at the current production value, I would halve that.  They should have a bundle that includes the entire Vanguard Campaign and include some Vanguard heroes for Co-op with that for ~$2 per mission for the whole pack.  Assuming they plan on making the campaign about as long as SC2 campaigns and bring the quality level up, that would be ~$60.  For the people who buy it piece meal, then they would have to get the Co-op heroes separately.  The top tier bundle should be at little pricier with some of the cosmetics, ~$80.  I gave the Kickstarter $200, and I don't regret it (although it was incredibly irritating to see items I would have to purchase in Early Access after giving them that much).  I recognize that you're largely buying a dream on Kickstarter.  But I can't in good conscience recommend people buy anything at the current value proposition, as much as I want this game to be a great success, I feel like releasing what they have now will drive more people away than it will bring in.

QoL:  There's no pause button in single player.  Seriously?

Only buy content as it is now if you understand going it that you're mostly funding development and what's there needs significant work.",1722484992,2024-08-01 00:03:12

steam,171203635,"This game (so far), seems promising. In general, it is better than most RTS I've been experiencing coming out, but it isn't quite what I hoped (yet). So, I'll lay out some Pros and Cons

Pros:
Very snappy/clean responses times (Good for general game feel)
Intuitive systems for picking up the game (Good for new players)
Damage feel exists (It is good to get a feel for unit damage when first using them, it cements memories)

Cons:
- Not where I expected it to be (Campaign and art/animations which I'll expand on)
- Campaign/story feels... thrown together. It has good threads, but voice acting feels uninspired and the characters are hard to look at.
- Information citation (I have to look around my hud, find my hotkey, use it, find the building which isn't obvious by design, then hover said building to get information about it) I can't say this is outright back, but it definitely needs work.

In general, the game has a good basis, and I look forward to seeing where it goes, but it definitely needs some polish. I also don't have very high hopes for the campaign if it continues down the current path it is on, as it feels overly uninspired and like a rehash of prior RTS campaigns chopped together.

- It doesn't do anything too crazily new, but it does take basic mechanics, modernize them a bit with things like the global build hotkeys, and add their own spin to it.
- is it fairly balanced? we don't know yet game is fairly new
- is the campaign outstanding? no, don't ever buy an early access game for its campaign - wait until the game is done before buying for that lol
- replay system exists, just not good (missing features, but you can watch whats happening lol)

After playing a few rounds and playing some of the story in Stormgate I have found that this game is fun. I have enjoyed the casual feel it has and that I do not have to feel so fast paced in a world that has evolved to everything that must be fast paced. I will say that some of the cinematic does need work, however if that is the style the devs are going with then I maybe I need to appreciate the art style a little bit more when it comes to the effects of the cinematography during a mission. It just feels weird to see an amazing cut-scene at the beginning only to turn to something different mission to mission. Thought, again if that is the style then good on you devs. 
There are a few other features that seem a little clunky, but this is early access after all, and I look forward to seeing what new and exciting changes some our way. I personally, who have enjoyed many RTS games, think this game is a breath of fresh air and will continue to enjoy it. I cannot wait for the F2P so my friend can join me and we can Co-op it up!!

I'm not a huge fan of the art style that does not make the game look like a ""next gen rts"", but I can bear with that if the rest of the game is good. The sound design also is very unbalanced and there are not a lot of memorable impact sounds, but given it's early access maybe that is alright. 

The campaign is just ok, it doesn't really pull me into the world like a good story should. It's not as bad as many reviews here say, but it's not amazing either. 

The monetization just goes way overboard. The campaign is very short for the premium AAA price it costs. The co-op heroes are all paid except one and have no way of spending your time to unlock them for free which makes the entire game mode feel pay to play.

When I played the early development it was completely different, the game has changed so much and in all the good ways. The Frost giant has been completely open on goals and progress on the game, what they plan on doing in the future, and has worked with the community a lot. Many people who criticize the game expect it to be feature-complete, and that's okay. Right now the game isn't for everyone, I struggle with the game and I have 60+ hours already. 

If you are interested please try the game, but understand the game is not near feature completion.

steam,171197809,"I want to start off by making it clear that I want to recommend this game. Most of the names working on it are people who I I know can make a good solid game.

I think someone nailed the problems with ""Roblox Starcraft/Warcraft"". To a degree, that makes sense. The people who are working on this game made those games, and therefor I would expect some influence and maybe a few cheeky nods to their previous works.

But as it stands, while the multiplayer seems relatively well balanced to start, the other elements of the game are struggling to escape its Starcraft DNA. From the ""B.O.B.s quoting an almost identical voice lines, to the story having the exact same story arc as Warcraft 3 (except crammed into 6, honestly very small missions vs the 9 of Warcraft 3s human campaign) The dialogue isn't terrible but its extremely derivative. Like the choice was consciously made to be so in order to either invoke nostalgia or because of an unwillingness to write something new. It doesn't help that, as much as I think hes a good voice actor and chill dude, Chris Metzens Thrall voice immediately breaks any new immersion. The game Features an item inventory in the style of Warcraft 3, including half the icons literally looking like they should belong in Warcraft 3.

The co-op, likewise, feels like very early Starcraft 2 co-op. its the same system of ""Pick a hero to get slight variations on the faction, grind to actually get to use those differences"". Starcraft 2 started here but has long since evolved into very different and unique commanders vs the ""minor tweaks to base game"" factions they started with.

No in game tutorial, especially given how diverse the differences are between the factions, feels like a huge miss. The campaign preview does onboard you with the extreme basics of the most RTS familiar faction, but the lack of even just a ""Meet the infernal host"" in game rundown of ""What does this faction do differently"" would be massive considering just how different the factions play (especially the Celestial Host). No in game viewable tech-tree as far as I can tell. So you just have to kind of ""Know"" what techs will go to what.

No ability to manually save during single player or even restart a mission (requiring going the long way of quitting back to the menu and restarting there) are FUNDAMENTALS. Im sure theyll be included in the long run but it just really tells to me that the focus has been almost exclusively the multiplayer component when this core system isnt even implemented.

It just comes off as this very weird vibe where the developers are unapologetic about making a ""Totally not Warcraft/Starcraft"" sequel, but the amount of effort thus far (at least for the single player/co-op content) only comes up to about what I would call a really well developed Starcraft 2 custom map and while Starcraft 2 is now getting old its not like its gone, its still very much there to be compared and contrasted to. And while I would like to say that Stormgate could claim ""Well, there have been no competitive RTS games so that'll be our marketing window"" Age of Empires has been going strong, Northgard and Dune have been going strong, there are other RTS games with better content out there, and they didn't have a 40+ million dollar budget.

I'm still hopeful it can get there, and its early access so clearly they realize it needs more time too, but right now its ""I can't believe its not Starfcraft""",1722475325,2024-07-31 21:22:05

This is where you can clearly tell that these are ex-blizzard devs.

Visibility: 6/10:
Improved from the beta, but still much potential. Sometimes it's hard to tell units apart.

Graphics: 3/10:
They could have done much better. I don't know why they thought this graphics style would be appropriate for this audience. No Fortnite or Valorant player will suddenly play a RTS game because it uses a similar stylization.
Also, what happened to the models of the main characters in the campaign? They are simply put really ugly. All of them. I really really hope that these are just placeholder models.

Campaign: 5/10:
The Mission design is once again core blizzard, it feels pretty good. But the cutscenes look horrible, the characters are uninteresting or just cringe (especially the villains).

Co-op: 7/10:
It works, it's fun, it's 70% stolen missions from Starcraft 2. 

PvP: 8/10:
This is where most effort went into and it clearly shows. It's fun.

I recommend this game for those that are mainly interested in good RTS gameplay, a fun time in co-op and PVP and good Campaign mission design.

You can't queue more than 5 units to build in a building, and there's no circular build queuing. You can't even queue if you don't have the resources. When selecting units, you get the portrait of every single unit, so it's very hard to actually count and maintain a ratio of units, e.g. melee to ranged. The pathfinding is [i]terrible[/i], and units can't walk through each other so melee heroes sometimes get blocked from the action by their own units and just pace back and forth. You can at least set a rally point on a unit, which is nice. There's a hotkey for selecting all (combat) units in the game, which gives you an idea of the level of strategy the developers expect you to employ.

The whole thing just feels like a pretty toy using dated UX and controls from literally decades ago. If this is supposed to help reinvigorate the RTS genre...well, I feel bad for RTS enthusiasts.",1722469901,2024-07-31 19:51:41

steam,171190801,"Update 3/5/2025: I've put a lot of time into this game (relatively speaking) and I must say, it is fun. The co-op content can be good and challenging at higher difficulties. I'm not one for PvP, so I can't say how good or fun that is, but I really have enjoyed my time with the game so far. The only issue is the price and the in-game store. If you pay as little as possible, you'll have access to basically no content. Even if you pay the full $60, you don't get all the co-op heroes. Are individual heroes worth $60? I'd say no, but I can't make that call for you. I understand that a game by a small team needs a constant source of income to stay live, but none of the microtransactions seem like good deals for both parties. I know it could be worse, but as I stated in my original review, I expected better from these devs.

Original review follows:

It's not worth $60 right now. The game is okay. It has potential, but the singleplayer content is just bad. There's effectively no tutorial for the only campaign faction, and the other two don't get any tutorials. The development team clearly has a focus on multiplayer, which is fine, but most of their pre-release material focused on the fact that they were the creative leads behind Warcraft 3 and StarCraft 2. This set certain expectations for the singleplayer content that Stormgate is not currently meeting. I won't go so far as to call it false advertising, but it was a little malicious and scummy. There are only 6 missions so far. They aren't very long or difficult, nor are they terribly interesting yet. Worse, it seems like the writers are just re-hashing their old material again. I won't spoil it outright, but the protagonist just went through a very short version of one of the team's past protagonist's journeys. I was hoping for something...new.",1722464417,2024-07-31 18:20:17

I have been following this game's progress since the very beginning. I did play the beta, and I played it at DreamHack Atlanta as well. The game has come a long way since then, huge improvements. 
Played all 6 campaign missions, they are fun, albeit short, the story has a lot of potential. I can't wait to finish the whole campaign and re play all of them on brutal. Mission 4 is my fav so far, I enjoy defense type missions. 
The COOP is where I am having the most fun and where I see myself spending the most time. 
The 1v1 scene I am sure will develop into a crazy meta and can't wait to see what the pros will be able to achieve.
Still have a lot to learn about how to play all 3 races, they all look and feel different, very original stuff. 
There is still some polish to be had but that will come as the game develops.

But... it just feels like a cheap copy of SC2, everything screams that this game was done by small studio, mediocre style of the units, mediocre graphics, cheap looking UI. Music in the game is not even comparable to SC2.

The game is alright - kinda feels like Homeworld 3 as it tries to go into an esport direction too. I just wanted the single player to be good, and maybe play a little online but optimizing the game towards esports has taken a toll on the story and production quality, I think. It's a bit janky, but not _bad_. 

I don't even want to contact them to see if I still could get the full campaign, it's just not that good actually.

I'd say it's better Early Access game than Baldur's Gate 3 was at the time when it released as EA.

For the past 1 year I see great progress with the development. Let's hope it'll continue to get better.

I know a lot of people don't like the art style but I think that's subjective and it's hard to expect AAA Blizzard art & models from a 50 people company. The units feel responsive and the engine seems to handle a lot of units pretty well in co-op when there are hundreds of units on the map.

I think 1v1 is the most polished mode so far, but I had a lot of fun in co-op as well, although it's not quite finished yet and we still have to wait for the 3v3 mode and map editor.

I did write a review directly after playing the campaign, but deleted it the next day and thought I'd give it another chance. Well here it is. Stacraft this is not. I do not consider this early-access either it has paid content in it so yeah. Races have a bland design, and I literary could not care less about learning more about them.

steam,171186363,"This is tough since I really wanted to love this right away. I'd say it needs a bit of polish - for example, the level briefings seem super cheap - character mouths aren't animated, presentations aren't detailed in a way that makes it feel there was any investment... they just sit there like bobble-heads while words magically sound off from their motionless mouths... It can leave a person wondering what they are paying for. 

My initial feeling is that It feels rubbery which is a bummer. The good news is that I have jumped in the ""Early Access"" fun so there may be a ton of things I put here that are being addressed. On a positive note, the team behind this game have added a ton of neat game-play features and have left the door open for some excellent collaborative functionality down the line.

Currently it feels like a ""Discount StarCraft"" knockoff. Also the unlimited frame rate as a default maybe isn't a great idea. I have a Geforce RTX 3090 Ti, with 34 g's of ram and a 12th gen i9 which generally handles anything just fine but ran hot. After looking at the settings and throttling the frame rate a bit it was better but the game is still super resource heavy - again, maybe they are working this out. 

I'd say IF you accept the game is in early access then proceed with tempered expectations. On the other hand, if you're craving a new RTS campaign experience that rivals the presentation, story telling and delivery of Blizzard maybe wait a bit. 

For now this seems like the whole game will be more focused towards pvp and competition with the campaign experience being a complete afterthought. If I had to guess, I'd say the whole goal of pushing this game out is to attract arena competition contracts to generate revenue for stakeholders - if that's the case, it's sad that its so obvious. Given that it is early access I will return in a few months to see if the whole feel of the game is less ""Tonka-Toy""'ish.

This is not what I backed. It's a busted SC2 clone with an equally bad mtx.

Even got a reply from a dev when i brought up my mtx concerns, and they went on a rant about how it's all ""free"".

Excuse me... but no. One mode is free, everything else is a demo at best.

I went $60 on kickstarter, so i don't get the refund option. What does that $60 get you? A crappy and very short ""campaign"", 3 extra co-op heroes, and a FEW cosmetic fluff pieces.

What DOESN'T it get you? The rest of the 2024-2025 roadmap, which is bringing 5 or 6 new co-op commanders at $10 a pop. So even if you crowdfunded this to get it off the ground and supported it through to it's Steam release... you're still gonna shell out $50-$60 plus for co-op. The future campaign stuff is a ""who knows"" but probably get charged for that too.

And the absolute audacity of the dev who responded to that saying ""well it's 'free' so why are you complaining"" was it for me.

This game is going to flop, cause it's not a replacement for SC2, it's not a competitor in the current RTS genre, and the entire mtx during Steam EA is a suicide mission.

Day 1 microtransactions in early access? Are you insane?? You're not at Blizzard anymore. This kind of predatory anti-gamer nonsense has been getting shot down for years, and you guys just went all in.

I'm absolutely flabbergasted that a team with this much experience would just copy-paste an existing ip, and do such a piss poor job of it.

steam,171185211,"New review for release version: Game has been fully released now, and I will review it as a full release.

Stormgate is a free to play 1v1 PvP RTS. For the small minority of tryhards who seriously engage with RTS 1v1: Maybe you'll enjoy it. I couldn't say, I only tried it briefly. That said, you may have trouble finding good opponents, as the game's playerbase is currently tiny.

For the rest of us who expect more from a game, like a campaign mode and a fleshed-out co-op vs. AI mode: Stormgate has those, but you have to purchase them separately. If you want a mostly-fully featured game, the Ultimate Edition bundle will unlock most of the co-op commanders, as well as the campaign, for an undisclosed amount of money.

No, I'm serious; there's an in-game store where you can buy it, but it won't tell you for how much. If you check out this bundle as a Steam DLC, you'll find that the Ultimate Edition costs 65 US Dollars; the price of a modern AAA game. Is Stormgate worth that asking price?

The campaign can be best described as generic slop. The story, the dialogue, the characters, the gameplay; all of it is eminently forgettable. I couldn't be bothered to care about the characters or the conflict even when I was in the middle of it all.

The co-op game mode is the best the game has to offer so far. It's rough around the edges, but you can probably have a good time of it playing with friends; even if your friends find RTS games daunting, there's a Buddy Mode you can turn on which has the AI build stuff for you, so you can focus on controlling your army. I personally found Buddy Mode downright infuriating, but I can see how it could be helpful for noobs; it's also the only advantage Stormgate has over more refined Co-op RTS experiences, like the one from SC2.

Stormgate may be free to play, but nearly all the content you could want from it is behind a paywall, so I am reviewing this as a fully-featured 65 dollar game- and it's decidedly not worth the asking price. The main thing most players want from an RTS is a great campaign, which mixes great worldbuilding, characters, storytelling and gameplay- and for the most part, Stormgate falls flat on its face here. AI could have written better a better setting, characters and story than what Stormgate has to offer, and AI is notoriously not good at this.",1722457427,2024-07-31 16:23:47

steam,171184621,"I'm a big fan of the RTS genre and will always support fledgling attempts to breath fresh air into it. I've supported this project and others like it - ZeroSpace, Godsworn, Grey Goo in the past, to mention a few. I'm sharing as someone with a decade of experience each in SC1 and SC2. Having this game released to EA, in this state, at this time makes no sense. I'm saddened, but this is a miss.

On fundamentals (i.e. game engine, netcode, overall game direction) experience during the beta was that as unit counts increased moderately, performance took a nose dive. I've also had mixed experiences with the netcode in multiplayer. Now in EA I still feel these problems are present. The delay between actions becomes noticeable in coop after 10min, after 20min it's unplayable. Units become unresponsive even with queued up actions. The proprietary tech to remove lag, feels like a downgrade or hindrance. SC2 a game over a decade old doesn't stutter this badly with maxed supply 8 players on the map. Maybe it's the poorly optimized UE5? Why leverage a high fidelity engine for a fast paced game and then still make it look fairly muddy? The choice of engine and backend of the game may allude to modding opportunities in the future in terms of features and capabilities, but none of that is actually being delivered today.

On gameplay and game identity I see little innovation. Classic design patterns were taken from WC3 and SC2 and fused into an uninteresting experience. Other games often take core RTS recipes and carve out their own identity. Supreme Commander focused on attrition and the frontline tug of war with a high volume of units. Spellforce infused RPG mechanics into the gameplay and had heroes progress with skill trees. I can't tell what next-gen innovation Stormgate is going for. Almost all mechanics are a lesser version of WC3 and SC2: you can find Zerg and Undead in the Infernal faction, but with diluted, low impact mechanics. See white health - an attempt to make another form of health like regen and shields feel unique and drive aspects of the faction around it. This feels too minor and just a thin veneer to allow the balance team to juggle numbers. It reminds me of how Dune or C&C factions were too similar with small tweaks in numbers and a handful of units. Faction asymmetry should be more extreme (see Grey Goo) and define game style more. Vanguard is just a more generic Terran/Human faction with upgrades and abilities that feel uninspiring. There's a certain numbness to the macro, creeps, and objectives. I feel like I'm playing an amateur mod of WC3. The factions have distinct features and artwork, but within each faction everything blends together.

On player control the game advertises itself as addressing beginner frustrations in classic RTS designs, while keeping competitive elements alive - I predict it will leave both core audiences unsatisfied. Hotkey control is now split between local infrastructure (rally points, placements) and global command cards. Streamlining UX order issuance to a global level instead of to individual structures was something other games have attempted, and I see Stormgate committing the same mistakes. It trades some hotkey complexity by introducing other forms of busy work and instead introduces layers of ambiguity and other micromanagement quirks. On top of that there is still plenty of complexity/ambiguity in managing rally points and building construction placements. Beginners will still struggle, whereas competitive players will have to adjust and learn to leverage the quirks. The QoL changes feel minor and make the game/UX feel outdated. Other UI elements like feedback (sounds, alerts, notifications, pings, etc.) in managing macro elements feel missing. Panning feels off. Zoom levels feel off. Spending time tinkering with the settings seems to barely alleviate overall clunkiness.

On design, animation, and other aspects that can be polished down the road - there is a monstrous amount of work. We're probably years from a full release. Take something simple like the Co-op heroes' global spells and compare them to SC2 commanders'. Several of the Vanguard spells are defensive, reactive, with low agency. In contrast SC2 commander global spells or respective unique abilities often dictate the strategy of the commander and are usually flashy, aggressive - they make you want to invest in exploring the meta progression of each ability further. All aspects of the game - campaign, coop, maps, lobbies, feel too anemic - there's so little substance here to build on.

Ask yourself what makes Stormgate leave its mark in the annals of great RTS games? I can't put my finger on anything specific. When you don't take any risks, you won't reap any rewards. I'll be back in a few years to check in again. Godspeed.",1722456723,2024-07-31 16:12:03

steam,171182268,"TLDR: A RTS that needs some work. Campaign in a rough spot, co-op fun but has performance issues.
At the moment i recommend the game ONLY if you want to play a 1v1 RTS games. Everything else needs some more time in the oven. 

The review will be updated over time.

First the Good: 
Good beginner RTS thanks to the innovative build hotkeys, auto groups and helper AI.
It feels like a mix between WC3 and SC2 in a good way. 
The 1v1 pvp mode is fantastic and by far the best thing about this game. It brings back found memories of early SC2. 
Factions are varied and have a ton of depth. 
Co-op is good but suffers from performance issues when there are a lot of units on screen.

The Mixed: 
There is no way to learn what each faction does in the main menu. Coming from AOE4 which has a dedicated learn tab in the main menu this feels like a HUGE oversight. 
The game expects you to go online and look up information.

The Bad :
The campaign is not in a good spot and it feels like no effort has gone into it which is a shame because they are charging money for them. The cut scenes and models are real ugly up close and the missions feel uninspired. 
This was a thing i was incredibly excited for because i truly believe you can tell some great stories with RTS games.
I hope they put more effort into it in the future. 


There is no dedicated skirmish mode or any decent AI to fight against.

I hope for future development, in this latest patch with Stormgates it's alright.

Suggestions for Frostgiant:
-Maybe ADD the coop heroes in 1v1 ranked (You can purchase them for money) So they make money.
-Add the camps back and give item drops for the heroes. (Like Warcraft)
 Some shops in the map, I do think make this game more like Warcraft is better than look a like of Starcraft.
- With the Warcraft style, keep the Stormgate for pressure and decision making.
- Add 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, and more for teamplay with big maps.
Mods for arcade games ( like footmen ect.)
All and all i play this game since early access and its getting better and better, but it is far from good yet.
It needs to be better or all players leave like they do now. The comminity is 300 players active at time.

To be a great RTS there must something to do for casuals, hardcore players and Pros.

All that said, the bones of a tremendous game are there. The base engine feels good, units and fights are responsive, etc. The game has the feel of the ""Blizzard RTS"" as advertised. TTK and fights are slower than SC2, but faster than WC3. The factions are very asymmetric and units are unique. I play VG personally and find the vulcan to be a very fun unit to mess around with, for instance. 

On the flip side, as a true EA game, there is very obvious need and room for polish. Bugs are easy enough to find, audio mixing and animations need work, campaign needs fleshed out. I feel personally that those are easy fixes to layer on top of the strong foundation. 1v1 balance is a continuous process that never really ends, 2v2 and 3v3 are on the roadmap, along with social features and expanded campaigns.

Update 0.4.0:

This update made the game feel brand new to me. new campaign, awesome new reworked units, and multiplayer feels the best it's ever felt.

I was already a fan of the game, so no change on my recommendation, but I urge you, if you've been holding out, or tried it previously and weren't impressed, give this new update a try. The game is really turning into something special.

Update 0.1.0:

The game has had a massive visual overhaul this patch and it is making a huge difference. The ground textures are way improved and the lighting makes unit and building models feel like they're part of the world.

Game balance is constantly improving and so is performance. This update is fantastic and a really encouraging sign of what's to come.

Been playing in the beta and I'm in love with this game. Each release it's improved more and more and I feel like the EA release was the one i was really waiting for.

I love the campaign, it's a total throwback to WC3 (not sure about the story direction currently. It feels a bit TOO much like a throwback to WC3. But i'll withhold final judgement on that front until we get more story.) Level design? Impeccable. It's more of that WC3 SC2 goodness.

Given it's EA, i'm being a but generous with that statement. it's true that there are bugs, some visual weirdness (particularly in the cinematics and character models), and areas for improvement, but it's a really really strong foundation to build on. Since I knew I was going into an EA release those issues aren't dealbreaking for me, and don't take away at all from my enjoyment.

In fact, given some of the reception, I was pleasantly surprised by just HOW good it is.

Co-op is really well designed, giving me a challenge even with 2 allies by my side, and that was just beginner difficulty, which I had expected to cruise through without even trying. (for reference i played and beat the prologue campaign on hard). But it always felt beatable (it would be quite something if beginner difficulty didn't feel beatable haha).

1v1 is currently where the game SHINES. It has had a lot of time in the oven and it shows. The races are all really cool and fun to play with varied options. The minute to minute feels so good, and watching pros play is amazing.

I'm especially glad that the EA release has improved the ground textures a lot, with better shading. The game generally has massively improved visually from the last beta release (frigate).

The 3rd tier units and upgrades are epic so glad to finally get to play with them.

monetization is a bit on the high side, but is pretty much on par with SC2. if you felt like you were getting good deals from SC2 monetization you should feel comfortable here. It's just on the edge of feeling overpriced to me personally. But I can't deny that there's a lot of effort put into the heroes and campaign missions you're buying. Those for sure feel worth it. The cosmetic stuff seems a bit too pricey for how superfluous they are. Like the pets in your base are cute, but $6 cute? Eh, not sure.

Fortunately those pets aren't required, and they're already giving some away as part of the campaign package rewards and stuff.

Fog of war shaders are interesting, i'd probably never buy one tho. If i'm gonna buy cosmetics, I generally want to buy stuff that I can show off to people.

I really believe in this game and this studio. What they've already accomplished with how little dev time they've put into the game is amazing. For my money, this has every chance of being the SC2 successor that Frost Giant wants it to be.",1722446122,2024-07-31 13:15:22

steam,171174855,"This is going to be a weird review, I'll post the TL;DR here. There is 3 camps I think that exist in the world of RTS. for 1.5 maybe 2 of the camps, this will be a thumbs UP. That being said, what I would give a thumbs up to is FREE. This review is being based off the money you would potentially spend on the game, mostly for campaign. 

First off, the 3 people who play RTS games, at least in my mind, are the 1v1 ladder heroes, the casual that plays with friends, and the one who gets the game, plays the campaign for some fun RTS story and uninstalls. Identify yourself with one of these and you can review my thoughts on each below, as through my life I identified with all of them.

1v1 is good! I cannot stop laddering, and I like it a lot. It's nice to have an RTS with the responsiveness and cohesion that Stormgate has. Frost Giant did an amazing job with making the Celestials somewhat unique in their race mechanics, as much as it can be unbalanced at times.

Casual gameplay with friends is....there. Unfortunately I do still think that SC2 has a better co-op campaign mode with a wide array of maps, objectives, and cool side stories in the greater universe. The co-op commanders feel somewhat similar overall, with just a different heroes. There is not a lot of variety between them in all honesty.

I think the most upsetting thing is that co-op commanders in SC2 have completely different playstyles, even within the same race, and feel unique. And they were sold for 5USD on average. In Stormgate they are the same race, mechanically with a new hero for 10 dollars a piece. I really hope this isn't the case going forward for commanders going forward, or I will not continue to purchase them. 

As for team ladder, I don't believe it is in the game, the UI is somewhat difficult to search through, and if it was there, I was actively searching.

As for the campaign, I must say, AVOID. It is laughably not good. The story is so disjointed and I have never felt more detached from a game's universe as much as this game. Which sucks. The intro cinematic, which we saw at Gamescom, got me really excited for this new universe. On top of this, the cutscenes are not finished.

As for the gameplay, I played on the hardest difficulty, and I am in no way good at RTS and beat both chapters in about 30 minutes a piece. The maps aren't very interesting and the story along the way is just not there. In SC2 Wings of Liberty, the tutorial was you taking over the legendary Jim Reynor while you start a rebellion versus the new self-proclaimed Emperor Mensk. It felt cool, it felt immersive. The tutorial in this mission is finding chickens. It feels like this world isn't actually at war.

Rounding it all out, this review is mostly for the paid content. I'm not going to insult the devs and they work they put in. But charging 10 dollars for a commander that feels no different, and for 25 dollars getting ONE CHAPTER of this campaign is highway robbery. As mentioned in the post, I got this game for free and I still feel like I was ripped off. 

I would love to change this to a positive review. But unfortunately I am cynical and you can update and change cinematics to look cleaner, update lip syncing, but you cannot change the mission design and poor worldbuilding.",1722445384,2024-07-31 13:03:04

I've had loads more fun with this game than any other RTS already. It's less stressful than any of the Blizz RTSes, less demanding than an AoE, and just very comfy and cozy to play in general. It's skillful, but not the razor's edge balanced skill that so many other RTS games require. Mechanically I think it's just awesome.

steam,171173405,"I really, really wanted this to be good, but oh boy... 

From the very first screenshots that were shared the biggest overwhelming point of feedback was that the artstyle is not good and not suited for the game. It's clearly stylized in the same way as fortnite/mobiles games with the intention to appeal to a broad market, but the broad market was never the target audience for this, it's hardcore RTS fans. Their unwillingness to budge even one centimeter on this issue has left us with a game that is straight up unappealing to look at. 

And while I wish that the artstyle was the biggest problem, it sadly isn't. The biggest issue arises from the inevitable comparison to SC2. 

This game is supposed to be and was marketed as a spiritual successor to SC2. And despite coming out 14 years later it plays, runs, looks and sounds worse. It's just straight up an inferior product on a technical level. 

When you play a few games of SC2 and then jump into Stormgate the difference is jarring. Units are less response, pathfinding is worse, the graphics look blurry, sounds lack impact... you get the point. There's not a single point where I can say that Stormgate does something better than SC2. 

I know some people while counter this by saying that SC2 had over a decade to be polished, but I don't think that's true, SC2 got a ton of updates regarding content and balance, but the core gamefeel was basically already there on day 1. BUT even if we were to grant that argument, I don't think think Stormgate will be afforded that amount of time to fix things. When SC2 came out it was a huge critical and commercial success and was backed by Blizzard (when they were still making good games) meanwhile Stormgate sits at 2k players and mixed reviews at the time of me writing this. 

Sadly to me this feels like yet another crowd funded project with good intentions but bad management. Instead of focusing on the core game and tight gameplay and expanding from there they wanted to have a campaign, 3v3, co-op and e-sports level 1v1 all at the same time and the result is that everything is half baked and stands on a poor foundation. The fact that they already announced that they also want to fund a global championship this year fills me with even more dread... 

To me it feels like the game is not even close to being ready to go into EA, because it will make a bad impression and highlighting it with inorganic e-sports will be even worse. But I think the decision is mostly driven by the need for more money because they managed to burn through they funding (which was advertised as being enough until launch, not the beginning of EA). 

I'd love to see them turn this entire thing around, and SG turning into a huge success but nothing about the entire project gives me hope for that. As is the ugly art and lacking gameplay makes me not want to play it. :/

steam,171173218,"I backed this on Kickstarter at the Founder tier. (so I have the Ultimate Early Access tier in terms of Steam).
I went through the various Betas with middling results.
I then tried early access and already see a paid hero available on day 1.
Went through the first campaign mission and it was, at best blase.
Played 1 game of Co-Op and it was about the same as the earlier iterations.
I don't have any interest in the 1v1 ladder so I can't speak to how it is performing in this iteration.

Overall though, I do not find that the instant monetisation of heroes/commanders -- with the first one being 16.7% (may vary some depending on y our region/currency) of the price of the Ultimate Early Access pledge to be nothing short of insulting. A single hero/commander and it's over 16% of the cost of the most expensive Early Access Bundle.

However, randomly generated symmetrical maps would have been more enjoyable.  Hotkey remapping freedom is lacking.  Unit collision needs more fluidity, which for some reason seemed to feel better in the first beta for me.

What does ""Ultimate"" mean anyway. I know what i bought but didn't think we'd get 3 bland co-op characters instead of the one that had it's own trailer.

The story is utterly boring, no one cares about the characters, except WARZ and the buildings are so unimpressive that i can't even tell them apart.

steam,171170709,"The massively anticipated Stormgate for any desperate RTS fans has had a large list of concerns and complaints ever since their previous betas were made available to the wider public, and many devote fans have been telling everyone to wait because it'll get better.

It's now early access, and while this is still technically true, many of the initial criticisms towards the game seem to be only getting worse and even longtime followers are started to realise they've bet on the wrong horse. I want Stormgate to be good as much as the next person, I pledged £200 during their kickstarter out of my own desperation, but no matter how much I spent I'm not going to pretend a turd isn't a turd.

The art style/direction/aesthetics are bad and continue to be worse. The campaign is laughable in both quality and writing, voice acting is bland and uninspired, character designs are blocky monstrosities that look terrible and, even if they polished up some of the animations and features, unless the model was fundamentally removed or swapped out they would still look awful. They look like toys with disproportionate arms for swivel points, or something a child would draw at 4 years old with even a plastic sheen to match.

The game feel is clunky and unresponsive, unit path finding is terrible and something I've experienced in other solo dev RTS projects; you have to get path finding right with an RTS. Units get stick, spin around, interrupt actions to try and do something else, and all sorts.

The sound design is awful, whoever worked on the demons just played around with multiple mixer components and tried to overlay them all together giving demon voices that are reverberating 10 times over, bouncing from each ear, making it a challenge to hear or stomach over repeated dialogue. Sound levels are all over the place with things jump scaring you sometimes, or announcer voice lines overlapping and spamming (control point cap-contro- contr- control- c c- c control point captured) every update. It's sloppy.

It also just looks poor with visual noise and clutter. The new race celestials are reminiscent of transformers triangle-esq robots and are completely uninspired while also lacking that clear distinct information. When I first loaded the game up in 4k I had to triple check my settings to see if it really was in 4k because nothing looks crisp or clear, there's some noticeable blur to even text elements which I don't understand.

I've played RTS games all my life starting with WC3 but played through pretty much every major noteworthy adaptation and unfortunately this feels no different to any other unnamed indie studio attempt I've tried, the only difference being they've been funded a tremendous amount of millions to make this, have ex blizzard devs, and to their credit they've got a functioning versus mode for all that money compared to what I'd expect from an Indie dev...but having match making is the absolute bare minimum I'd expect with this compnay's reputation.",1722440630,2024-07-31 11:43:50
steam,171170391,"TLDR: Highly recommend playing on the 12th, maybe caution shelling out for the preorder packs.

Cons:
- The campaign.  If you're looking for a single player experience look elsewhere. This may be a pro for some that are looking for a competitive RTS may not desire them to put a lot of effort here, but it might have done them a favor to even just leave it out at this point and its not a reason to preorder.
- Performance can drop at times, even in 1v1.
- The UI is bad, same as <Insert Blizzard Game Here>.  Everything is too BIG to look nice.  Please look at UI's from other studios.

Pros:
- Coop has a progression to it to provide purpose to play, and feels a mix of Warcraft and Starcraft.
- 1v1 seems competitive and even the AI can provide some challenge here.
- Ultrawide support.  I pretty much can no longer play SC2 because of my dislike of the resolution alone.

Pros or Cons:
- The upgrade system is ""different"".  It doesn't allow you to really focus on a unit as much as it emphasizes using a diversity of units.
- Strength in battle seems centered around use of abilities.  I don't think people will play this game the same as they played SC2 and be successful.  Micro may matter more here.",1722440242,2024-07-31 11:37:22

Previous review below

Combat wise its good.  Story wise ummmm what the hell is going on?  I'm like 5 missions in and not much in that regard.  As to the hero units ummmm bland and storyless so far I am nearly at dislike with our main heroine for the humans they really need to be more fleshed out with more story.

Overall I'll give it a thumbs up for the combat only but I nearly have to go the other way they really need to improve the story and flesh out the charecters you are following more.

Like it literally looks worse than the first release of Starcraft 2 and its over a decade later. And trust me I want the RTS genre to make a comeback, but this feels like a cheap knock off at best.

By the way: you can't save in campaign.

Didn't try matchmaking since I don't want to jump in before getting comfortable with all races  and I also can't find any clear MMR / Achievements system.
GUI is bad.
Units controls, visual and sound are kind of ok.

As a big fan of wc3 and sc2, I can't find any argument why you should play this instead of wc3 reforged (didn't think I would ever recommend it) or sc2 campaigns.
As for now this game has nothing to offer.

I paid for it and microtransactions day 1.

If you're a campaign player I'd say to stay away for now as the campaign is definitely the part that needs the most work (from a pretty foundational technical and narrative perspective). But the PvP is really, really good, with a skill ceiling that's still just as high as one would expect from a blizzard style RTS but a skill floor that has been lowered just enough for players like me, who bounced off of SC2 ladder, to feel like they can get the hang of it. I like the Coop quite a bit as well.",1722438467,2024-07-31 11:07:47

steam,171168291,"I'm over an hour in, just completed the prologue, and I gotta say I'm not impressed with anything other than the mechanics.

The characters and units feel flat and absent of the personality I've come to expect from the Blizzard games whose mantle Stormgate is attempting to take up.  There's so much less to Amara after an hour of play than the first few lines of space-cowboy Jim Raynor or noble shaman Thrall, even down to the confirm and poke dialogue.  For many that might not be a problem but I have always valued how much personality I feel from Warcraft and Starcraft units and heroes.  I'm not even going in expecting deep and complex story just something to grab hold of atmosphere-wise.

The world has been taken over by demons and scavengers pick through the wreckage but the art design is flat like Plasticine.  I want to be getting Starcraft meets Diablo but I'm getting Overwatch meets Hearthstone.  Much as with the feel of the units and characters the art itself doesn't connect with me and the entire affair feels sanitised like a saturday morning cartoon, only those cartoons tended to have more personality in their character and art design so... it's a real shame to see the game in this state.

If Blizzard's RTS games were extremely adolescent in their approach Stormgate could be described as being extremely childish.  Is it more financially viable to have a scrubbed-clean approach in the modern gaming space?  I don't know.  But I am disappointed to see the team chose that approach over the scrappier, goofier, edgier games which I was hoping it would be inspired from.

I probably won't refund it because I do wanna see Frost Giant succeed and the RTS genre come back from obscurity but hot damn I hope these elements are part of the 'early access' stuff that gets fixed because I'm just not feeling any of it.",1722438018,2024-07-31 11:00:18

The art style is not great. The campaign is abysmal. Co-op is mediocre; I'm hoping it gets better with time.

I purchased the Ultimate EA edition and have some buyer's remorse so far. I felt like I had to support an ambitious RTS project like this. Hopefully some major improvements are coming down the line.",1722437457,2024-07-31 10:50:57

The game overall seems fine the gameplay is good the story feel like could be a bit better even though we only have chapter 1 on early access.

The thing that makes me sad is the cinematics, I have to say this, the only cinematic that looks good is the first one when you open the game for the first time, the ingame cinematics are very very bad, a lot of camera shaking the characters feel like they don't fit in the map, it feels like the cinematics were fan made by a guy that doesn't know how to make cinematics

steam,171167236,"Let me start by saying that I don't game as often as I used to, and that im only a few hours in. 

However, I've read community feedback and watched matches and streams, and this game is very refreshing in the market in terms of adding strategic depth, in terms of numbers of choices you can make/variety of builds/added diversity and variable through the creep camps, while simultaneously streamlining and lowering the skill floor in terms of spamming and managing various hotkeys and control groups. 

I feel like you get to pay way more attention to the actual combats, and there are more genuine strategic decisions to make compared to it's predecessor Starcraft II or other RTS where those decisions only present themselves if you are fast enough in terms of economy and macro. In other words, I feel like Stormgate brings back the Strategy in Real Time Strategy to the average player, while it was somewhat less dynamic and more about getting your timings right and making a bigger army faster in the genre, for the majority of the playerbase.

Now, if you are someone who likes a story, stunning visuals, compelling plot, and are single player oriented, the game won't suit your needs in it's current state that is definitive. But the main audience of this game are e-sport competitors and fans, so their number one priority was game mechanics, and they did nail that above expectations. In general, I feel like it's a lot easier to improve aesthetics, voice acting, story, etc. with a strong core mechanic than the other way around. Also like others have said, this game is far from finished, it is an early access game, in ongoing development, and to tailor the game to it's audience as precisely as possible, they need our feedback and they've already proven that they listen to it and act accordingly.

Overall, if you are looking for a fresh, dynamic, engaging, PvP oriented RTS game, buy or support without hesitation, this is the most likely candidate to carry the torch for the genre.",1722436808,2024-07-31 10:40:08

Designed for kids?? Dumbed down  which is funny since people who play RTS are the ones who like difficult,skilled games. Game needs at least 1 whole year just to be in a ""ok"" state. They shipped it out since they burned through all the money and need the dough. Excepted more from ""Future of RTS"" Only good thing is that this game made me re-install starcraft 2 again.

Positives:
- Feels like wc3 to play, so some nostalgia is here.

- Coop (it is in a terrible state) but it is here, and coop was really fun in sc2 I glad developers also think so.

- One of the few games of rts genre that was released in almost 10 years.

- Art style is ok.


Negatives:
- It would stand no chance if it was realeased in the same year that sc2 released, Quality doesn't improved in 10 years. And budged here isn't a problem.

- Terrible design of coop / single player mission, people who created them had no idea what they are doing and just make it look like sc2/wc3 missions, they play terribly have no semblance of story progression or player choices.

- Feels bad to play because it lacks visual hints. Can we have a animation of main base being upgraded? Can every level of upgrade look slightly more different?

- Units feel uninspired, you got 2024 technologies, you could make units that blow up the terrain, unit which size is so big it covers part of the map whatever, no here we dont even have big units like thors or ultras, meh.

- Early access, why is it in early access for 60$ with payed commanders even though you got like no real content in the game, and the one you have for coop/single is worse that hobbyist maps from wc3?

steam,171164361,"Stormgate is the first real Blizzard-like RTS since Starcraft 2, which released 14 years ago. I'm very happy to play a game like that again. I have have mostly focused on 1vs1 but the campaign also seems to have cosy Warcraft 3 vibes from what I've seen.

The game has 3 interesting factions and I haven't really decided which one to main yet. That's because all three factions have interesting things to offer.

One of my favourite things about this game is that Air-units are not that powerful. They have more specialized roles. This puts a higher focus on ground to ground combat but it also has some ground to air/air to air combat that is not boring to play. The worst experience in an RTS is when the opponent turtles in the base and just masses capital ships, or when the answer for that is to go mass air yourself. Stormgate also have map objectives in the form of creep camps to make you want to be out on the map.

Besides that it is a very good Blizzard-like RTS, Stormgate also has very good music, graphics that I think are nice, with good animations and there is good potential for interesting gameplay between the factions. Some of the sound effects are a little harsch, but it's early access, that could be improved.

I hope that Stormgate succeeds so that we as RTS-players have something good to play over the coming years.

I was an early kickstarter supporter and I am enjoying the game. I've played some 1v1 and I played through the campaign. 

The campaign borrows a lot from the stories and tropes of Blizzard RTS, and it feels unpolished. I know it's early access, but I would like to see huge improvements before I drop money on future campaigns (mostly around the variety of missions, the animations for in game cutscenes, and the overall fluidity of the characters). 

I think the game has a lot of potential and I will be diving deeper into the 1v1 scene (Remember how slow and awkward Wings of Liberty was when it launched? Go watch the first GSL finals if not) and I'd like to see how everything plays when we start to understand the meta and balance changes over time.

-they try to make it accessible via use of MOBA buttons (QWER) for base management, which in turn makes it easier to play

Cons:
-it really feels like Frost Giant asked Blizzard if they could copy their homework, but didn't care to not make it too obvious
-it has many connections to Blizzard games, but it feels like it is too many
-basically copied Reinhardt, Tracer and put them as campaign heroes but forgot to add any identity to them
-all 3 factions seem like a copy of Diablo, Starcraft, Warcraft and Overwatch models, you literally have walking Azmodans and Ogre Magi on the battlefield
-there is pretty much no originality in this game, coop mode interface seems like ripped off from SC2
-prices for additional content are insane, SC2 coop commanders were 1/3 of Stormgate prices and they had more levels + prestige system
-campaign feels bland, you guys copy everything from Blizzard games but did not copy the best features of the Wings of Liberty, Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void. There is literally zero customization between missions, zero additional story telling.
-characters are boring as hell, they are basically making another Arthas story with Tracer having a power trip due to a cursed weapon, sounds familiar?
-3 out of 6 initial campaign missions are $10, 2 of the paid ones are pretty much copied The Dig and Zera'tul mission 1 from Wings of Liberty, you guys even copied the drill
-items do not show any stats, you have no idea how much they impact the game if at all
-leveling system of characters feels awful
-cinematics look like they've been made 15 years ago, I swear Wings of Liberty had better
-animations look awful and clunky
-even multiplayer is a joke, you can harass the enemy base as Infernals accross the map with cracked up eye of kilrogg

I get it this is an unfinished product, but you are already charging a lof of money for it. It never should've left beta in this severely undercooked state. As for now I definitely do not recommend this game. This is No Man's Sky all over again.",1722431836,2024-07-31 09:17:16

Units control well, they are similar to other RTS units with a small twist generally. I think they nailed health/damage, and when you're caught up in a game, it feels great. The graphics are ok, but not good. What's really lacking are the sound/special effects. It's hard to get excited about it when the attacks look and sound uninspired. There's no punch to them at all.

I finished the 6 campaign missions available on hard and the first 3 are essentially tutorial levels that are rather bland. The 4th mission is easily the highlight of the campaign. When it really kicks in with enemies everywhere, the game ran great and felt great. The plot is alright but very similar to another RTS you might have played. Voice acting could be better, but the presentation is off. The unit models don't look great up close but are fine top-down when playing.

The campaign is as bland as unseasoned mashed potatoes. Bland story, bland missions, and bland characters—did I mention it was bland? You’ll find more excitement watching paint dry, and it’ll probably look better too.

They managed to recycle every overused mechanic and cliché in the RTS book. You can almost hear the developers in a meeting saying, “What’s the laziest way we can design this game?” If Stormgate was trying to win an award for mediocrity, it would be a strong contender.

Now, I get it. Not every game can be a masterpiece. But to sucker everyone, including myself, into thinking we were getting a AAA game only to deliver this huge letdown? That's just cold. If only they’d listened to beta feedback rather than deleting posts faster than I can alt+F4 out of this game, maybe—just maybe—they could’ve salvaged something worthwhile.

If you love SC, SC2, WC3 but want to play something *new and different* Stormgate is the best ""True RTS"" experience.  Playing in the Campaign on launch day, I was getting flashbacks to my SC, SC2, and WC3 campaign memories - Stormgate during Early Access is good enough to do that.

I use the ""True RTS"" tag above because games like Battle Aces - which I am a huge fan of - are more innovative but they cut out the depth that is exciting to explore in a game like Stormgate. 

Stormgate's paid Early Access is for the biggest fans BUT - for everyone else - the game will be free to play in two weeks. There will be no reason not to play - or at least try - Stormgate when F2P launches.",1722431493,2024-07-31 09:11:33

It has the hero gameplay from Warcraft 3 and story wise it is like a mix between StarCraft 2 and Diabolo. From my player icon you can probably guess that that would be something I like.
If it is going to be free eventually give it a shot but the monetization as it stands now doesn't give you great value. For the 60€ you don't get everything unlocked and there is very little as it is.
Of course they will release more content but as it looks now for much more money to pay.
The character writing also leaves much to be desired. In the first campaign you play Amara a commander of the Vanguard army who would fit better into a coming of age story of 14 year old kids in their puberty. Doesn't give me high hope for a revival of the great characters of Warcraft / StarCraft.

For me it really depends if the custom game modes pick up. I am hoping for something similar to what append in Warcraft 3. If that is the case I don't mind the meh value as I just see it as a donation button for enabling the custom game modes but until they deliver on that front I am going to wait.",1722431482,2024-07-31 09:11:22

This game is the adage ""Don't fix what's not broken"". Also this ain't the next gen RTS, that goes to Age of Mythology Retold if the launch of that game is successful. I bet it will be more successful than Stormgate.

This game has lots of cons more than pros so If I were you never pre-order like me or in any game just never pre-order. Wait for at least a year or more to see if the game is still alive. So many bad decisions from the veterans of Blizzard.  Kevin Dong's design on co-op never innovated basically  copy-pasted the same formula from SC2 while adding an extra player. Here in Stormgate, we get only get 10 levels instead of 15 levels for talents. Everything in this game felt rushed and the game should have more oomph because didn't it get the biggest kickstarter of up to 2 million dollars? 

The marketing of this game is horrible too, just one trailer for IGN when the early access launched. I know many Sc2 veterans and other RTS lovers are giving this game a negative review because the promises were so overhyped but nothing in the current shows the potential of this game to be the ""next-gen RTS"", it is basically a downgrade from SC2 and even when compared to the Age of Empires Definitive editions.

steam,171157243,"Giving this a tentative thumbs up at the moment, because this game is succeeding in at least one dimension.

If you enjoyed 1v1 matches in Blizzard RTS games like Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3, there's a good chance you'll like them in Stormgate as well. It's engine is responsive, units feel good to control in the way that Blizzard games did. There's some interesting ideas at play with each faction, and the modern touches to the controls are much appreciated.

If, however, you're looking at this game for the campaign or co-op, things are a lot more of a mixed bag. I've only played the 3 prologue missions now, I'll update this after I complete the paid missions.

The good: Missions are competently designed, and I enjoyed them. The first mission is slow, and the weakest of the 3, but it's also clearly an introduction to RTS for unfamiliar players. The next 2 missions ramp up pleasantly and were engaging.

Mission 3, for example, opens with a brief introduction to a stealth unit, and then transitions to an assault on 3 bases with optional objectives that grant you AI controlled companion armies, culminating in a simple boss encounter. Pretty solid!

The bad: There's almost nothing to engage with on a character level here. Dialogue is incredibly bland, characters feel like a jumbled rehash of Blizzard tropes but without the charm. Unfortunately, the cutscenes are cringeworthy. I was looking for a crumb of inspiration or style in the prologue missions and it's just not there. There's nothing to latch on to, emotionally.

Co-op: (I'll update this after playing more)

All said, Stormgate feels like it's being designed by a team that is technically very proficient, and it's genuine fun to play. But the execution of the plot, characters, and artstyle is passable at it's best and downright embarrassing at it's worst.

If you're looking for the presentation and polish of Starcraft II, you're in for a huge disappointment right now. I really want this game to succeed, and I hope that improvements can be made on the campaign side of things.

On the other hand, if you want to try your hand at a new competitive RTS, this might be right up your alley.

I played SC1 and SC2 for thousands of hours and so far this is exactly what I was looking for - similar gameplay, but with less ""oneshot"" situations like banelings or disruptors where you blink and loose whole army - in this way it is closer to Broodwar than SC2 in gameplay (which is good), but with 2024 controls.

""[Frost Giant] set its valuation internally, without a formal third-party independent evaluation.""
(...)
""Frost Giant has calculated a valuation of $150,000,000 for the Start Engine crowdfunding in 2024.
(...)
""This valuation is based on the historical performance of our prior product, StarCraft 2 Wings of Liberty at 50% monthly active users. Since our product closely resembles StarCraft 2 and many team members at Frost Giant worked on StarCraft 2, we believe 50% performance is a reasonable estimate.""

Wings of Liberty was nothing short of a cultural phenomenon, google the live reaction to its announcement in Seoul. This is not the climate Stormgate is launching into. Obviously. To think it will have half of WoL's monthly player count (which was in the millions, remember this was when RTS was at its peak and very much in vogue and in pop culture) is nothing short of delusional. 

Either Frost Giant genuinely (and misguidedly) believe that they are the actual messiahs of RTS and can change all of gaming culture overnight, and have pitched as such to investors, or this is deliberate misinformation. Neither is better than the other.

Anyhow, if you want to verify since I had to cut out a lot of fluff, I don't know if steam will like me posting a link so just google Frost Giant SEC filing and look for the SEC.gov website titled EDGAR Filing Documents for 0001665160-24-000316.

steam,171153355,"1v1 is fun.  The stormgate objectives add a unique dimension to 1v1, giving a lot of variation from game to game and helping the game find its own identity.  In my opinion the game has struck the absolute perfect balance for time-to-kill.  Units don't die almost instantly like they do in sc2, but at the same time fights are not as painfully slow as they sometimes can be in Warcraft 3.  The fights are paced very well and it makes for the most fun types of micro for me.  

The QoL/UI type features like quickmacro, automatic control groups, and even stuff like how it saves screen hotkeys between games are done very well and make the game feel very good to play.  Hotkeys are also fully customizable (including changing modifier keys) and minimap can be put on either corner of the screen, something that some other RTS games fail at.

Campaign is decent.  It's not a stellar storytelling experience and they don't have the funding that blizzard had to create those impressive cinematics, but the gameplay is pretty fun.  It gets a lot better in the later missions.

Co-op and 3v3 are not done yet but have a lot of potential.

The game's best asset is its engine and its potential with editor.  It has by far the best engine and pathing of any RTS since sc2.  And the editor and custom game scene will be the next version of wc3/sc2 editor and custom game scene if the game does well enough.  The developers have worked very hard on these two things, while other new RTS games skimp over it.  In the long-term, it will be worth it.

If you ever want to get a ""starcraft 3"" or ""warcraft 4"", support this one.  They were financially forced into this early launch but the long-term potential of this game is still there.  The other upcoming and recent rts games don't have the ambition that this one has.  They all either skip on features, have subpar engine/pathing, bad UI/hotkey customization, and/or lack editor support.  It just needs to get more time to finish the co-op and 3v3 modes.  Try 1v1 and campaign.  They are both decently fun and you will be helping this game reach a more complete state where it could become a truly special rts.

The only thing Stormgate has over sc2 is that it is gonna have active dev support, but the game itself just a massive downgrade in every way, and even tho people say its just early acces. Frost giant is pretty much out of money, they used up much of the investment they got, so the future of it is not very promising either.
The campaign is hilariously bad, straight up comical, I would  be disapointed if this was a game from 1999, I cannot understand how much worse this is then the Wings of liberty campaign that came out in 2010. The intro cinematic is okay, the ingame cutscenes are impossible to find the proper words for, I speak 2 languages fluently and neither has a good enough word for it. The models look like it was made by somene who just found out what Blender is, animations are worse then wc3. The writing, the story, the setting, the voice acting is all very very amatourish and cringe. The gamepaly is not bad, but nothing special either.
1v1 multiplayer is the best part of the game, but that says more about everything else. It is just... uncreative and unintresting. It is not bad, but why play this over sc2? It just takes sc2 and drops a bunch of random stuff in it that don't work very well together, and changes a couple of things from sc2 that people complain about without taking into account what effects that has. For example creep camps, FG just thought ""wc3 has creep camps and they are cool lets add it"", but creep camps don't work in SG because its not WC3, there are no heroes, items, exp, so the rewards are very boring and pointless, there is also no depth to it unlike in wc3, there is no high level creep manipulation, no meaningful micro. They also slowed down the game pace and removed splash damage pretty much. But there is a very good reason sc2 had that, because it doesn't work in a slow pace the game is not build for that, what we got is a game where fights are long and boring with very small amount of intersting interactions with the enemy. And high aoe is needed to punish deathballing a problem that plagued sc2 always. Runbys being easy to execute, low risk high reward is also needed, because it insentifieses attacking, and makes just sitting back and turtleing easier to punish, thus making the game more actionpacked and fun. Did FG adress any of these problems at all? No and it doesn't seem like they will, there is no creative vision behind the game like it was with sc2 and wc3. I watched all the interviews they ever did, and looking back they never once talked about a vision a goal that they want to achive. Deepest they go in terms of game design is ""wouldn't that be cool"" and ""lets remove this because some find this frustrating"", with this aproach you are never gonna make a proper succesor to sc2 and wc3.",1722419874,2024-07-31 05:57:54
steam,171152631,"Has the following issues:
- Graphics are pretty mid. The art can range from kinda good(weavers), to downright horrific, and not in a good way(long-necked hero, amara's eyes holy frick they gouge out your soul). Most of it is pretty mid and I don't find a lot to really wow me here.
- Faction designs are kinda hit or miss. I didn't personally find a lot here that really appeals to me. I tend to like non-human things, plants, etc... and the factions are just humans, advanced humans, and then infernals. So I play infernals. If you're a humans enjoyer then you'll find plenty here though.
- UI doesn't support custom hotkeys and this makes it EXTREMELY PAINFUL to play the game if you want to do anything that's not with their current setup.
- Haven't played campaign yet so can't comment on my own personal experience, not sure if I will bother with it though given what I'm getting from other people's experiences.

If you can get past the issues though, the pvp can be pretty decent. That being said when it comes to where they are going with pvp gameplay, what they want to accomplish and what gameplay patterns they are trying to incentivize, it's pretty unclear. They seem to want to increase the amount of engagement with camps, but at the same time they make the resource games require more investment of unit HP to take than before the patch which disincentivizes taking them until you have a larger army. Speed/health camps can only do so much when it comes to incentivizing people to skirmish with their first few units. Might as well just a-move my brutes into the enemy base.

I think thirdly that the lack of new T3 infernal units is fairly disappointing. They made 2 T3 units that are new for vanguard and celestials but then simply took the top bar ability for infernal, cut the animus cost in half, and then required T3 tech + even more resources than before in order to make it and then they didn't add anything else. Fairly sad that the faction I'm most interested in didn't get anything new there.

Roadmap seems to imply that they will be doing the next iteration of t3 in 2025, which is more disheartening.

Longer term balance wise for the forseeable future in 2024, I am worried that inf late game just won't be able to keep up with the rest of the factions due to this discrepancy.

As such, I'm going to have to go with a rating of ""no I don't recommend this game"", but it is somewhat a matter of personal taste for me.

steam,171152437,"-The 3 factions are original with smart mecanics (Depending of which unit you put in the bunker different things happens)
-You can do PvP which is extremely limited (Maybe 10 differents units for each factions, 5-6 tacticals abilities)
-The main goal is the ""Coop"" mode, the same than Starcraft 2 Coop commanders, you have Heroes that modifies factions from different ways and you go on a randomly selected mission after each game you level up and gains new things
-Some creeps camps where you have towers to capture (Remind me of Warcraft 3 but in less good)

Sadly i put a negative evaluation due to :
A) Lack of content (Releasing an RTS where your same units don't have differents faces in 2024, weapons, bodies, etc... is criminal, sorry i come from Total War

steam,171152429,"I want this one to do well, and I'll change my review if it gets anywhere near good for launch. Sadly, for right now, it's just not good enough.

I enjoy the multiplayer, and the co-op missions, but I really play the game for the campaign. So, here's a review of that:

- From a gameplay perspective, these are good, if a little unpolished. There are some clever mechanic here: from using tornadoes to kill your enemies, to evolving your main character by finding them a weapon. I liked the 4th mission especially, although having a timer would've been nice.

- That said, these are NOT playtested. Some typos around are whatever, but it feels like in every mission there's something that is supposed to work, but doesn't. There are lore tidbits around, but in the second mission, you can't pick them up because you don't have a hero at that point. Also on the second mission are these units called Infiltrators -- who have 2 voice lines TOTAL, so you're stuck listening to that until you can get rid of them. On mission 4, some of the ramps don't work. You can't pause, or save, and the 'load checkpoint' has no information. On mission 1, if the mercenaries roll 3 ranged units, your hero just dies on Hard difficulty. in the INTRO. There are 2 loading screens for each mission, 2-3 clips of story, and yet it doesn't feel like I'm playing a story. Let's get into that: 

- From a writing standpoint, they're awful. Stilted dialogue, reductive plot. They try to mix in goofiness with some of the lore books, and those are good, but then they still try to have their main storyline be serious and completely removed from the tidbits, so it doesn't end up working. Everything feels like it's written in shorthand,  The characters are one dimensional so, from mission two, you could guess exactly what they were going to say/do. The flashbacks do NOTHING for the story, especially considering we've already seen exactly what she's thinking about. Is her whole character --sitting in bed and thinking about her father who died 20 years ago--? Because that's not compelling. Everything feels bland, played out, and contrived. They seriously need better writers -- or to employ some dedicated ones, if they haven't already (I'd do it for free). The poor writing is obvious from the moment you launch the game: the boring names of the factions and their units were CLEARLY not thought through, like they created the units and their names before coming up with any of the lore. We have Protoss, Terran, and Zerg -- and we have them with no new ideas, and barely any old ones. (Look, I'd stop comparing this game to SC2 and WC3 -- if every third thing in the game wasn't a reference to them.)

- That said, the above makes the Voice Acting all the more incredible. I don't know how much Stormgate spent on VA but it must have been a lot to get this cast, and to have them sound this well. Even with prequel Star Wars level dialogue, even with delays between voice lines (don't worry, Baldur's Gate had that problem too and they won Game of the Year), the voice cast does really well. I'd love to see a full list, because I feel like I recognise the voice of almost everyone.

- Finally, there's no progression. Starcraft's campaign was so effective because there was both progression and choice with how you played the game. You could upgrade your marines, get automatic gas geysers, etc. from a home-base. You collected resources that you could spend to improve your army outside of individual missions. So far, there is NONE of this. The only progression you get is 
a) technology just becoming unlocked between missions with very little explanation, and
b) your hero getting a better weapon. 
Maybe that's the problem with releasing the campaign in batches. Maybe they just didn't prioritise the campaign (leading to the question... what did they prioritise? Certainly not the cut scene graphics, or the sound, or the optimisation), or maybe its still coming for full release. But right now, it feels empty, it feels boring, and it feels like the RTS renaissance is going to pass Stormgate by. 


Besides the campaign, it's a pretty good game. I mean, it's objectively worse than Starcraft, released 14 years ago, or WC3 Reforged, a game outsourced and then abandoned, but for a small studio making a little RTS, it's enjoyable. As I said, I like the multiplayer, the co-op is decent, and the mechanics are often clever (although I find the Armada boring to play, I think it's very creative). This game could so easily be good. And maybe it will be: on full launch, or on update 5.0, if they get that far. But for now, it's a no.",1722418623,2024-07-31 05:37:03

- For Starcraft 2 / Warcraft 3 Veterans: get it NOW (just for supporting the devs, not because of the early access perks).
- For casuals: wait until it will be free in 2-3 weeks.

This is why:

I see why a lot of people are not happy with the current state of this game. The first impression of the UI is that it is by far not polished. If you are a casual RTS player wanting to get into this genre, maybe by starting off with the single player campaign, you will be set up for the next dissappointment. Everything feels not ready yet. A lot of models are not in a good shape. But remember, this is Early Access guys, thats what Early Access is for. Unfortunately a lot of people tend to forget that. Early Access is meant for early delivery to us players and get as much feedback / data in as possible.

Coming from a product development perspective the devs have done a great job and i absolutely support that approach. Their priorities lie on highest value to their core players, which is, for now all the SC2 / War3 competetive players. And for that part the focus is on working mechanics, super responsive client server interactions and fun 1v1 skirmishes. And here they delivered, this IS fun and feels good. 

The other things will come, please understand that the devs can work only on some things at a time, they need to prioritize their work. Most important things now, fluff later.",1722413626,2024-07-31 04:13:46

steam,171145841,"The game makes no sense at all. The slogan ""next gen RTS"" is an absolute lie. But even ignoring that slogan and just looking at the game itself, there is nothing in it that even comes close to the level of Starcraft 2, Warcraft 3, or Age of Empires 4 (though admittedly, the game has little in common with AoE4 and is more of a mix of 80% Starcraft 2 and 20% Warcraft 3).

But that's the main problem: in no aspect does the game outperform any of these titles; it lags behind by 5-10 years.

Graphics - worse than in Starcraft 2, AoE4, and Warcraft 3 Reforged (if we consider the quality and detail of the units).
Sound - worse.
Music - worlds apart.
Campaign - 6 missions? The Nova campaign in Starcraft is far more polished.
Achievements - none.
Originality - the human race is just a cheap attempt to copy the Terrans from Starcraft. At least when Starcraft took the Space Marines from Warhammer and the idea from Starship Troopers, they did it brilliantly. The second race is somewhat better but still feels like a mishmash of Starcraft's Zerg and Warcraft's Undead. The third race looks interesting, but the graphics kill the concept.
Gameplay - why wouldn't I just play Starcraft 2, Warcraft 3, or AoE4?
Co-op - again, Starcraft comes to mind. What's the point of buying characters? How did you plan to fund the game? In Starcraft, people eagerly awaited playing as Tychus or Mengsk because they had well-developed backstories. What's even one small advantage over Starcraft here?

Overall, the main question is: why release a game that has no advantages whatsoever over the giants of the genre? It would have been better to polish the game for another two years.

The game is so bad that when you press ""A"" and the left mouse button, 1 out of 5 times it doesn't register as an attack move, just a wasted click.

I would also like to say that Amara, the main character in the game, looks so bad in the videos, images, coop selection, and the game itself that looking at her is like staring at a disgusting insect or vomit.",1722408951,2024-07-31 02:55:51
steam,171145833,"First remark I want to make is that I am writing this review one day after Early Access release, so I will also not treat this game as a full product simply because it is not.

So let's start with what is not perfect and has room for improvement so you know what you are getting into:

-Hotkeys customization is pretty lacking. At the moment you can't even change hotkeys to require 2 inputs instead of 1 and vice versa. So if the devs decided that jumping to a location is F1, then you can't change it to [Shift] + [Q], it needs to be ONE button. Same if the devs decided that creating ctrl groups is CTRL + 1, then all you can change is that [1] button, but it has to be [CTRL] + something. This is limiting for no reason other than probably technical/code reasons. But it feels really cheap especially in 2024.

-Automatic control groups is something that I really like as a trend for modern RTS, but here again just as the point above, feels like in its current version it is just a cheap placeholder for future system. Now all it does if it is turned on it assigns all units to group1, all ground units to group 2 and all air to group 3. Thats it. 0 customization whatsoever.

-Campaign quality is questionable for the price. It is planned to be sold in chapters with ~3 missions each. For a player that has experience in RTS and knows what he is doing this is probably around 1hr of playtime. The writing is also a little questionable so far (after 6 missions). 

-Coop heroes are locked at level 5. If you want to level them further and therefore make stronger then you need to pay. There is no other way to earn them, no ingame currency that you can earn to grind your way to it. This might be a problem once the game develops and there are many commanders it might become expensive.

-The entire game design is mostly a safe approach. Most of it is a polished version of Starcraft 2 and to a smaller extend Warcraft 3. There are not many bold revolutions just polished systems that we know.


So the above are the ones that I think are the most crucial for me. Let's talk about the good:

+Units are super responsive and perform the actions you order them immediately

+In my view units are quite easy to tell apart at a glance for the most part.

+Game is Free to play (you can play 1v1 without any limitations, coop with friends for free up to level 5 on all heroes and one hero you have fully unlocked, campaign is locked behind a paywall)

+Buddybot that is a system designed to help new players (meaning with 0 RTS experience) get into the game. This is a cool concept that may be helpful for many - I won't get into details how it works here but lets just say it makes the game a little easier by performing some actions for you so you can have a better learning curve.

+For the most part I like where it landed with the TTK

+If you like controlling stronger hero units you can have fun within coop and campaign, while 1v1 is a competitive mode without heroes, so I think it is a very good compromise for everyone.

+I think potential is a big part, we know there is a lot more content in the making which can be seen in details in their road map. 3v3 Mode is something I wait for. I believe with every update the game will only become better and better from here.",1722408939,2024-07-31 02:55:39

steam,171145300,"Having played a few hours, I'm recommending yes... with serious reservations.

On the positive side, there is a lot about the game that is fresh. The graphics are not on par with recent RTS games, but the art style is distinctive and campy in a way that has a nostalgia factor to it. The ideas behind the campaign suggest a story that COULD be interesting... with some reworking. The unit designs and race concepts are good starting points to be developed further. The races are distinct with some creative gameplay options suggested by the mechanics, and the difference is sufficient that you notice yourself gravitating to one more than another. I particularly enjoy the nostalgia of a game that essentially blends the entire Blizzard franchise into one platform -- including Diablo. The hotkey set-up is the most intuitive and clear arrangement I've seen in any RTS, and matches a style that I tried (unsuccessfully) to set to SC2. This and the macro mechanics mean that you have to spend less attention on the micro mechanics of building your army (no more having to return a worker to the resource line after building something) and you have more brain space for micro and strategy -- extremely welcome to folks like me who never fully mastered the craft.

Yet there is the ""with work"" part of all this, and the ""lots of potential"" part. Granted, the game is still in early access for now. However... The fact that unit portraits have no animation is an obvious let-down since similar platforms have featured moving portraits for 30 years now. There do not appear to be any plans to add this feature in either. The graphics, while nostalgic, are campy and underdeveloped at this time. Plenty of folks are disappointed on this front.

There is no good tutorial program. You can jump into the campaign and learn as you go, or you can create custom games in the online mode with a closed lobby. These games cannot be restarted (you have to completely reset them if you have a flub start), which is incredibly irritating. There are currently only three AI modes you can play against. Of these, only one presents any degree of challenge at all, and that one does not appear able to recover from a serious blow. Destroying an expansion essentially wins the match as the computer will not attempt to rebuild their destroyed expansion, even if you leave it alone for the rest of the match. The computer will not take another expansion instead either -- rather, it appears to follow a preselected serious of actions until it gets blocked, then it simply stops. This makes the learning curve less intimidating and more annoying. If you get past this to full PvP, and the game draws a significant player base, you'll be well on your way to many hours of fun.

There are enormous gaping holes in the mechanics. In particular, there is no save option during the campaign and no restart option. If you make a serious mistake, you must quit the campaign mission, return to the campaign menu, and start over with the intro videos and mission briefing -- all of which puts you back a good minute at least. The same is true for solo-play. The only way to play against the computer is to put together a custom level -- which you cannot restart even if playing solo. This makes learning the game significantly more time consuming and difficult. For such simple and standard mechanics to be absent at this stage is perplexing. This, however, is a small gripe because I find it difficult to imagine these issues won't be addressed -- and if they are not, that will be a MAJOR problem.

I see some real potential with the campaign story, but the writing needs a great deal of work. There is no build-up to help you enjoy any of the characters or dislike any of the villains. As a consequence, the heavy-handed leadership of the main character makes her seem incredibly bitchy. No independent thought around here (especially if you are white and male) or you might find yourself out of a job. This is a more fundamental problem than spit and polishing, this is serious editing and rewriting portions levels of let-down. There are indicators that the story MIGHT be going in an interesting direction over the long-haul, but only time will tell for sure.

My recommendation for now is avoid spending money on the platform. Play the F2P access when it opens in a few weeks and keep tabs on how the rest of the platform develops. The mechanical problems should be fixable, and although the graphics are disappointing in some ways, they don't break the game. Although the campaign material released so far won't necessarily be addressed, that doesn't mean the forthcoming campaign material will not be taken more seriously given player feedback. It could end up being a real gem.",1722408159,2024-07-31 02:42:39

steam,171144660,"Mostly played on another Steam account.

Things the game needs/lacks:

* A LOT more content! It is pretty barebones apart from 1v1
* Better visuals, character models in the campaign
* Unique units, unique campaign unit upgrades and progression in campaign (like sc2). Might be hard with the episode release schedule. Needs to be longer to allow you to to immerse yourself in the experience. Value proposition currently not there at all for beta backers.
* Visuals, feeling and overall direction need to be more mature. Young people don't play RTS as much or at all. Given the artstyle choice it should steer towards how dota 2 makes characters alive and handles visuals without making them look childish (not always). Some character sets for Doom or other heroes for example would look great for Infernals. (Maybe more details needed on every troop?) GOT BETTER IN 0.3
* Ground textures blend and look blurry compared to objects like cliffs and buildings. More detail/sharpening would look good. FIXED IN 0.3
* Game needs a looot more units that are fun to play, especially bigger ones. Would be nice to see 10 extra units per faction. More choices are always good. (Beyond all reason, total war warhammer etc.). 
* Heroes should add a lot more units and buildings in their gamemodes.
* Unit counters are not too clear or present at the beginning, just blob armies of general mix of troops fighting so Micro is not as applicable to casual players. More Micro potential of troop positioning benefits rather than focus on kiting units would be good.
* Mechanics mentioned like getting a choice of strategic/fun options from creepcamps would be nice addition. This would really make each game unique given a pool of random spells, buffs, bonuses or units. And would allow for new strategies.
* Not enough spells in the game that allow for fun plays, game seems more focused on simplicity and pro play.
* Needs more impactful and possible strategic decisions during 1v1. All the choices you make add up to victory, but they all feel minor. The most fun moments in RTS is coming up some kind of strategy on the fly and seeing instant feedback on your decision working. (Like baiting enemy units into building a different army via Hallucinations in Sc2, destroying an army with psionic storms etc., trapping enemies in a chokepoint with forcefields).

The game itself ran very smoothly for me and the gameplay is def tought over by the devs.

As a paid experience, Stormgate is hauntingly unimpressive. As a free experience, it's worse than Starcraft 2. 

SC2 comes with the entire first campaign (arguably the best of the 3), 3 coop commanders, all of multiplayer, and like 12 years worth of polish FOR FREE. For all the money they seemed to be able to generate, I can't for the life of me figure out where it all went. The art style is cartooney which I wouldn't mind if it wasn't so garish. The maps are bland. Literally all of the coop missions are straight rips from SC2's mode. Creeping is worse than WC3 and often feels pointless. What even is this game anymore? It's a hollow hybrid that successfully emulates none of what it's trying to evoke and feels like a massive slap in the face to the legacies the development team tried to lay claim to. There must have been something in the water all those years ago because it seems like it's nothing but miss after miss when it comes to the modern RTS. Stormgate fails to buck the trend, and is in no way shape or form worthy of your time nor your dollars. I'll continue to play it for my money's worth, but please just play something else.

It is currently in a state that would be suitable starting point for an Early Access release. Judging by the year's worth of work, the studio can further improve the game, polish the rough edges and add new modes that are currently in development if there is enough interest from players.

-----------------------------

I'd say no for the general public.

I have plenty of hours in, but those are purely spent in the 1v1 game mode, which is somewhat playable. The ""no"" is because there really isn't much more. More casually inclined players would probably expect team games, arcade maps, or an editor to craft interesting custom stuff. All of this is promised to be in the game someday, but whether it will really reach the level of WC3/SC2 is unsure.

To explain the somewhat playable 1v1 - there are issues with pathfinding, making one of the factions dependent on melee units really frustrating to play. Unit attack prioritization is not good. Key QoL improvements, such as BuddyBot (a helper with some macro tasks), are not available in the 1v1 game mode. Hotkeys are rough and not customizable enough. The gameplay is rather slow, with most of the time missing any interaction between players.

Campaign:
I really wanted to like this but sadly at the moment I can't say it's for me. Campaign story is a swing and a miss for me with it seeming to be filled with niches and cliches and an identity crisis that tries to go comedic and serious but achieves neither really well. The borderlands style graphics in cinematics make it hard for me to take it serious and a I had a feeling of nostalgia of starcraft playing but that with none of the characters I loved made it feel hollow. It felt like a bland melting pot with everything with an unoffensive outcome but that prevents it from having it's own special identity that sticks out.  Unfortunately this is something I can not see improving or being fixed with a patch since it would need an overhaul.

Multiplayer:
I didn't get to go into multiplayer coop too much past tutorial because time was running out for refund and I think the paid earlier access hurt the game in that regard.

Even with the Nvidia game ready driver, this game is clearly not ready. Loads to a black screen and then crashes.

Hopefully they'll avoid the rape and suicide stuff.

17 Dec 2024 Early Access Review Update
Game will launch now. I purchased this game through their kick starter campaign. I got the highest tier for digital content (don't care about physical content). Even with their Ultimate Pack, they have added an additional $60 of shit that should have already been included in their previous packs. Games that do pay for DLC during early access are just cash grabs. I say again, once Blizzard, always Blizzard. Hopefully they'll avoid the rape and suicide stuff.

Unfortunately, that coop mode seems half-baked. SC2 has more to it. Granted, I get that this is EA, still to be iterated on.... but my lord... $10 per new hero???? Absolute ripoff. SC2 had them for $5 at least. This is just greed. And asking for that DURING early access? You couldn't at least give us 3 heroes, 1 per race, so we can try them out?

I have a lot of issues with the game. The campaign isn't particularly great, and I would like some sort of meta progression aside from items, it just kind of feels like a polished custom campaign with VA and cutscenes that are a little wonky. I don't like the music, I'm not a fan of backing on kickstarter and then realizing that there is DLC character on day one. I'm not a huge fan of the art style, especially the infernals. 

What I do like is the story, I think it's pretty decent, and I like the core gameplay loop. I genuinely had fun playing coop with my friends, and I enjoy the QOL features that Stormgate offers. I can tell there was a lot of thought put into the design of the game. I personally think that when it comes to early access, you should look at a game as is, because there are no assurances that anything will change/get better, but I do hope that Stormgate gets the years of support SC2 had, and might one day live up to the WC3/SC2 pedigree it claims.

- The art direction makes everyone look doughy and cheap. Needs shading and repass on art direction (It's in the middle of a demon apoclypse make it look like it instead of a Sunday Cartoon Show)
- The story in the 1st chapter of campaign missions is just a worse version of warcraft 3's Human campaign.

Absolutely not. Its like they saw the meme ""let me copy your work, yeah but change it up  a little. Your first hero, not Tracer / Zeratul and her buddy not Tychus. Some how are in control of a army but the worlds population was pretty much wiped years ago? Yet somehow there's all these notes of people doing XYZ on tablets just littered anywhere. The tablets telling story would be nice but they almost add nothing and most of them are just extremely bland. They pretty much copy and pasted the first mission from WarCraft 3 for this game, hell in case you weren't sure they even added the wolf noise from WC3 for night time. Lets not forget not Cho'Gall at the end. Don't worry though somehow this backwater village has better voice acting then the main cast, not only that but they're trippin on Tracer for having the audacity to save her from slavers to late, like isn't this a post apoc world with no real army.

The story is bad, its a blatant copy and paste and SEVERAL AREAS. The creative team was apparently bankrupt. It wants to be a MOBA so bad it dumbed down the RTS mechanics to pretty much the equivelant of Dawn of War 3. 

If you want to play i would say WAIT FOR FREE VERSION FIRST, game comes off as a MAJOR CASH GRAB.

Edit - The devolper and i quote ""More playtime = more fun"" so to test this ignorant theroy im gonna try and give it another shot, if my review doesn't change id suggest doing A LOT of thought into this one, dev already blaming player base and ignoring major feeback.

Campaign story feels like the product of an uninspired focus group. Characters and narrative is unlikable, uninspired, and not engaging.

Performance problems are very noticeable even on high speced rigs when there are many units on the screen at once, game breaking for an RTS game.

only 6 missions are available and 2 are no build, 1 is basically a building tutorial, 1 is good, 1 is SCII zero hour but better (slightly) and 1 is stones tug of war but the enemy barely attacks and your hero is so OP it can solo the whole mission. 

The villain is a joke (just like Jenara from SCII, can we have an amen for the poor girl)
The writing is like from a B movie
The animations are budget at best
The characters... well lets say I feel 0 connection to any of them (except one which looks and sounds like general warfield)

There are THREE things in which this is superior to SCII

Its not blizzard
Artillery uses projectiles

Static Defense
Static defense is different based on what infantry you put inside: melee = ground splash, rifleman = air/ground long range, dog = radar, SCV i mean BOB = autorepair crane
Supply buildings can be upgraded to support static defense or the SD support support for higher energy regen or attack speed for SD

steam,171137885,"Edit 8/7/25: Have barely touched the game since launch but seems like it has had a lot of updates now that its out of early access. Went to check out what it looks like and the first thing I'm greeted with is the fact that there is now a $65 Ultimate Edition that includes all the heroes and such. So... I paid $60 to back this game before it even came out, putting faith in this company and its development. They didn't actually give all the early access content in spite of that. And now as soon as it goes live, for almost the same amount of money, someone who decides to jump on now gets several heroes and additional content that I don't?

Well if Frost Giant Games wants to keep saying screw you to the people that believed in them, then screw them. Not giving this company another gd cent. If this is how you are going to treat supporters, then I hope your game and your company fail hard.

Original Review: I was very hyped about this game. After playing around with it a bit, I kind of regret backing it for any amount of money.

It's not just that this game isn't *there* yet, it's that after playing it, I don't even feel like I have anything to be excited about when it gets *there.* 

I don't doubt that developers have put a lot of effort into this game, but it has a sort of soulless feel to it. It doesn't just feel like a knock-off of SC2 and WC3, it feels like a knock-off of their knock-offs. 

Campaign is abysmal, characters feel as generic and uninteresting as they come while trying (and failing catastrophically) to evoke a sense of nostalgia for much better characters from games of the past. Campaign levels feel like rehashed and less interesting versions of Blizzard's levels. And while the different races are technically mechanically distinct, the macro play feels completely unsatisfying and the micro-play feels simultaneously overwhelming and boring. Instead of the sense of excitement you get from trying out Zerg, Protoss, Terran, Human, Orc, Night Elf, and Undead for the first time? I felt very underwhelmed from the first moments. Every new unit that and new upgrade further increased that sense of ""wow, this is unimpressive."" With upgrades like +13% move speed (WOW!) taking the cake. I'm not sure if this is some sort of esports hypercompetitive edge mindset at work, but if so they got so lost in super-balancing 800apm esports that they forgot to make the game... you know... fun.

Maybe a great game will emerge from Stormgate over time, but this early access glimpse of the game doesn't give me any sense (or confidence) in what that may look like in the years ahead.

I wish I could offer some positives, but I don't know that there are any. Music, responsiveness, performance, unit design, macro, micro, mission objectives, graphics, UI, etc? I really can't think of a single thing that this game does well... except maybe pre-release marketing. 

And for those of you upset that the ultimate founders edition doesn't include everything that comes out on day 1? Don't be! Because nothing else they could add would even remotely address what a disappointment you'll feel after backing this game.

This is a good game, and its only going to get better these devs are dedicated and consistently show they know how to focus on the right things!

I do feel the need to add here, the early supporters for the Ultimate Package got burned. The new pack is GREAT, if you haven't gotten it, ITS SO WORTH IT!!! however they didn't have a way set up for early ultimate pack holders to upgrade. What would have been a 5 upgrade if we waited is now not obtainable lol. We can't go from our early 60$ to the new one for 5, wed have to buy Warz and Ryker separate and that's like 16 dollars if I want the 2 new characters.

steam,171135584,"[h3]UPDATE August 2025:[/h3]
I did play this shortly after its ""release"" back in August, but did not bother to update my earlier review until now when I had time to spare. 

First of all, I will say [i]they have made improvements across the board, including the campaign[/i], which is better than the ""first draft"" version they gave us at its EA launch. I do not want to ignore what positive changes Frost Giant did make over the past year pre-official launch—let's give credit where credit is due. [b]HOWEVER[/b], for every successful update or change they've made over the past year pre-official launch, there is still much that falls short of their own hype: 
[list]
   [*] The campaign's characters and story falls flat despite the notable improvements, [spoiler]especially at the very end of the last Vanguard mission[/spoiler].
   [*] The in-campaign upgrade systems rely on a single, stingy resource, making rewards less ""rewarding"" than even SC2 WoL's upgrade mechanic.
   [*] While most missions range from decent to satisfying, I didn't really feel any had that ""wow"" or ""cool"" factor/mechanic you'd find in other Blizzard-style campaigns. [spoiler]The only part that seemed closest to this ""cool"" factor was the beginning phase of the last Vanguard mission.[/spoiler] But there were some missions that clearly needed more time to work out its rough areas for the underlying map idea to shine through better.
   [*] The ""full"" game is still incomplete in major ways at launch, e.g., their ""Sigma Lab"" section within the game's main menu.
   [*] They redid the ""packages"" of ""mission packs + cosmetics"" stuff in a way that felt [i]diminishing[/i] for those of us (including me) who supported them during their Kickstarter campaign, especially at the higher tiers.
   [*] You still CANNOT SAVE [i]MANUALLY[/i] during solo play of campaign missions!! (FYI: They did include reasonable [i]auto-saves[/i] at the official launch, which is better than nothing like during their EA launch.)
   [*] NOTE: I did not play their Co-op mode or any multiplayer matches, so I cannot speak to those modes in my review.
[/list]
At the end of the day, I still feel [b]""mixed""[/b] about this ""official"" release of Stormgate. If I had to give it a numerical rating, I would give it a [u]6/10 at best[/u] for its overall state. Normally, this would be enough for me to give it a [i]positive[/i] review here on Steam, cause even ""mid"" games can be a positive experience for some players. 
[b]However[/b], I don't feel like I can do that with Stormgate in particular, primarily because [u]the changes and improvements were simply NOT ENOUGH for what they [b][i]promised[/i][/b] to the RTS community AND for asking so much financial support [i]pre-early access[/i] directly from their targeted audience.[/u] If you asked so much from us like Frost Giant did, then you needed to deliver, and frankly, what they released for their official launch seemed more like the kind of early access we were expecting last year. Thus, sadly, [u][b]I'm keeping my ""No"" recommendation for this game [i]after[/i] its August 2025 launch.[/b][/u]

[hr][/hr]
[h3]Original Jul 30, 2024 Review:[/h3]
Hmm... I wish there was a [b]""mixed""[/b] option in Steam reviews because that's how I'm actually feeling about this since it's July 30th EA launch.

I'm one of the very early supporters back during its Kickstarter campaign, so I've seen how much this game as evolved since its alpha build. With that said, however, [u]this EA launch leaves me troubled, [i]especially around its campaign[/i][/u] (which is what I usually look for in a great RTS to play in my free time).

[b] [u]To avoid spoilers:[/u] [/b] the story is rather rushed and you get [i]very little feel[/i] for the world or the characters by the time the provided missions are complete. The primary reason I could keep up with much of it is because I took half an hour to read through the in-game ""CODEX"" (located at the top center on the starting window where you choose which game mode to play) that has little entries on each character and location introduced in these available mission packs. Normally, that would be fine, especially for a game in EA. However,[spoiler] the last mission in the ""Chapter 1"" set has a story beat that feels like a major plot point and a traditional end to a classic RTS campaign vis-a-vis WC3 or SC1, [i]and we're only on mission six of the entire game![/i] [/spoiler] I was willing to overlook much, if not most, of the beta and EA messiness knowing that its development is still in process; [i]""let them keep cooking,""[/i] I kept telling myself. Yet, I now find myself hesitating with where they seem to be taking this new IP. 

Moreover, how the game adds ""lore bits"" through ""text drops"" that you have to pick up with your hero and then read in the lower right corner of your screen after hovering your cursor over its ""book icon"" in thin, white font while the game keeps playing (because there's no pausing in the campaign, even when you bring up the main menu) was tedious at best and frustrating at worst. [spoiler] On top of that, most of the lore bits were random ""jokes"" or ""gags"" that were neither funny (to me) or really added to the world/lore of the game. Those that weren't jokes didn't really add anything to the mission story-wise nor strategy-wise. [/spoiler] So I often felt frustrated that I was essentially being distracted from an actively running mission with little to no reward or meaningful lore to enjoy.
More importantly, there is [b][i]no [u]manual[/u] saving, reloading, or restarting[/i] in the campaign missions whatsoever[/b] that are already single player to start with. Yes, there are [i]some[/i] checkpoints, and if you reach a failure state in a given mission, [i]then[/i] you can choose to reload from the latest checkpoint. But if you want to restart a mission that's already going poorly for you or try something different without restarting the entire mission, you're fresh out of luck at the moment. It's either fail and reload from checkpoint or quit all the way back to the campaign menu and reload the entire mission, including all the mission briefing and cinematics (that you can skip through one-by-one) and loading screens before you can start playing the mission again. All of that was quite frustrating when you're trying out a brand new campaign/mission for the very first time, especially on a brutal run like I did!

Finally, I understand full well that as a F2P game by design, Frost Giant needs to monetize things like mission packs, co-op commanders, and cosmetics to help keep their budget in the green (although, I will say that I was peeved that the second Infernal commander is pay-walled for players like me who ""purchased"" the Ultimate Founders Pack ""pre-order"" at $60 USD; you'd think they would give us that before they started charging us for later content?), and I'm willing to consider supporting that business model if it means the base game remains F2P so new players can join the RTS ecosystem both here and the wider RTS community. [i]But...[/i] if the overall campaign ends up being as poor quality as this EA launch suggests, then I'll probably wait for potential discounts before chipping in anymore money myself in the future.

I can go on about the game's current PvE AI, frustrating unit pathing, story character models that pull me out of the immersion [spoiler] for how bizarre they come across every time I see them (think [i]uncanny valley[/i] kind of cognitive repulsion, honestly)[/spoiler], but this review is already getting a bit long...

...I really want this game and developer to succeed, [i]truly![/i] But I am, for the first time, actually disappointed with this latest direction of the game at its EA launch. I hope Frost Giant makes some adjustments---at least with solo-play mechanics---before the well of goodwill and player eagerness dries up.

steam,171135417,"I find it enjoyable, and what's out for the campaign is promising enough. The game is rather clearly not finished, but it's Early Access and doesn't claim to be otherwise. I don't think I'd recommend anyone pay for an expensive pack at these prices for this little unless they were really hoping for it to be a success and very patient, but with it being free to play on the 13th, I would definitely recommend giving it a look then at least, to any RTS fan especially. It's not where it could be, but there's enough here to prove that if given some time it will develop into a great addition to the genre.

I will say that I am not a fan of the art style, the vaguely overwatchy look being compounded by unfinished graphics and textures to be far too cartoony, especially when one considers that one faction is meant to resemble *demons*- it's not really possible to do scary demons in this style and it does a great disservice to the writing and the game as a whole. It is, however, probably too late to go back on that too far. One can hope that further development adds a greater level of detail that at least improves on the look, and while you DO at least get used to the look after playing a while, it has unquestionably hurt the game.",1722392639,2024-07-30 22:23:59
