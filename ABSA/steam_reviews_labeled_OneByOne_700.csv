204014740,"After playing all the game has to offer, hereby my final judgment of the current state:

Graphics: 7/10
The atmosphere and terrain look great, building and units are fine but not spectacular. The style is a bit cartoonist, but I don't mind that, it makes it easy to recognize what is what. 
Sadly a lot of models feel a bit unfinished, especially the character models and Ai faces are a bit off-putting, so I take a few points for that. 

Story: 3/10 
For a game that focuses on selling campaign chapters, the story telling and character development is medicocre at best, and horrible at its worst. And although the campaign mission play fine, the storytelling is... a nope for me. 

Gameplay: 6/10
The campaign missions are ""okey"", but the story drags it down into the mud, and it's hard to separate them out. 
I think with some polish the missions themselves could be a ""good"", but not when I played it. 
1v1 felt smooth and has working matchmaking and as it's free to play worth a try if you're into comparative rts games. 
The co-op felt unfinished so I will skip it in my judgement. 
They seem to be working on a map editor as well, what could be great in the long run. 

Unit control: 8/10
For both the campaign and 1v1 it feels great, sometimes the pathfinding is a bit off and there are some minor hiccups, but if the whole game was at this level we would be banging. 

Sound: 4/10 
Sound is all over the place, so I will split it up. 
First I encountered weird bugs during the campaign where sounds overlapped a lot or all of a sudden a voice is way too loud. 
Also, all weapons and effects sound off, they don't have any ""boom"" so to say. 
But then the voice actors are great, they can't help it that the lines they bring don't make a great story. 
The game music is also good, but the lack of enough songs makes that they play the same short song on repeat sometimes, what drives me crazy.
Overall really mixed feelings here, but not positive in the end. 

UI: 5/10
Feels and looks unfinished, but it does the job. I like the hotkey system they came up with though. 

Conclusion: 4/10
Let's quickly talk about... the micro transactions. Sometimes a system like this can work great, but I don't think it works here. 
The game 1v1 mode is free but the main selling point, the campaign, is paid for in chapters. Also there are heroes for co-op and classic cosmetics that don't do anything. 
As for now, that campaign is not worth the asking price and with that the whole idea of splitting it up makes little sense for me. 
The game is simply not finished, and with no clear sign if or when it will, I simply can't recommend picking it up. 
We will see if the develops can fix this ship, but it's going to be a rough journey.","[{""aspect"": ""Gameplay"", ""sentiment"": ""Neutral"", ""snippet"": ""I think with some polish the missions themselves could be a ""good"", but not when I played it.

 Would not recommend where it is now, CoOp is a lot of fun but it is so expensive to play as each commander costs like $5 minimum. Campaign is alright, amazing writing but just like coop its not worth $30 for about 3 hours of gameplay.

Long Version:

Pros:
 - A lot of differences to other RTS's, does not feel copy-paste
 - Gameplay is smooth and different factions are both diverse but still easy to pick up
 - Factions feel like they specialize in one thing over another, which makes you really think about what to play

Cons:

 - Some factions are too specialized, so they can feel bland and act like one-trick-ponies.
 - The cost, it is ridiculous for a game that is still missing about 60% of the overall game with only 1 campaign and minimal maps.","[{""aspect"": ""Gameplay"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""coop is a lot of fun""}, {""aspect"": ""Monetization"", ""sentiment"": ""Negative"", ""snippet"": ""it is so expensive to play as each commander costs like $5 minimum.""}]"

Unfortunately, the release was disappointing. The game isn��t very well optimized. Unreal Engine 5 is impressive, but for an RTS, performance is everything.

203103990,"Plays really well and has a solid multiplayer and skirmish mode. Well worth playing for these modes alone. I originally didn't really resonate with the races at first but once I started to learn them a bit better, it started to click more.

However the campaign suffers from modern writing and it makes it quite hard to take seriously. The overall story seems great actually but the dialogue is really bad at points. I feel like they definitely hired terminally online writers that need to disconnect from twitter and maybe spend some more time reading. I actually think this game would have done a lot better if their free missions didn't have such cringe dialogue that is so off putting. But with that aside, the missions are fun and the game plays really well and feels polished.

Overall if Frost Giant, can overcome its difficulties with the game and attract more players, I am really optimistic that this could be one of the great Starcraft like RTS games.

203085746,"When Stormgate was announced I was very excited for it. I played the early access and had many complaints but still had hope because it was early access. However, the paid cosmetics and pre-purchasing of unreleased content was pretty scummy for an early access game. 

Then ""full release"" was announced and I was surprised it was so soon, but I was excited to try it out again. I really liked the redesign for the Infernals and saw that they redid the campaign. However, it was not much better with the annoying weather effects (DAMN LIGHTNING), random upgrades in the lab, not enough research points to unlock the majority of the unlocks, not able to pick up resource pick ups with a full inventory, poorly written story with many plot holes, weak character design/building, forgettable enemy types, OP heros, and boring ""boss fights"" are just some of the complaints I had. 

For the multiplayer, it is very snow bally. You either get the first Stormgate and randomly get a good unit and push for the win or a player loses too many units and cannot hold the counter attack and gets stomped. The Stormgates feel like such a lazy way for incentivizing players to not turtle. The rewards being random and being a fighting unit is terrible. Maybe make it a way to get vision on the map or get resources. Also the unit balance/stats are unbelievably poorly tuned, the Fiend for example is so incredibly fast and does so much damage, early on a single pair can out damage a building being built which is an insane amount of pressure for the cost of one Brute. Infernals also lost the shields for standing on shroud so they do not really have a reason to spread it and spreading it is temporary for some reason? I know it gives some health regen but even still it was originally added to give Infernals a sense of ""territory control"" which has been lost. Vanguards have veterancy which seems the most powerful of the faction bonuses of the three. The siege tank equivalent is able to be picked up by the dropship WHILE IT IS SIEGED, which is one of the most busted things I have ever seen, especially when they are able to delete an entire base's worth of workers in one volley. For Celestials, you are able to mass expand and unless the enemy cheeses you then you get away with it. Celestials just seem like an unfinished faction and I know Frost Giant said they are going to overhaul the faction BUT IT IS IN FULL RELEASE SO THAT IS NOT AN EXCUSE ANYMORE.

Finally, the shop is full of overpriced cosmetics, which is fine for a F2P game but $5+ for a companion that just roams your main base is just plain greedy. Also two of the main pillars of the game are not even complete, those being CO-OP, and the Map editor. Not to mention the CO-OP campaign and Team Versus are not out yet which is mind-boggling as those are being advertised as the main pillars of the game yet they are not out for the full release.

Ultimately, I am completely disappointed with how Frost Giant treated Stormgate. They wanted to bring RTS to a new generation of gamers but ended up releasing a rushed, buggy, unfinished game which leaves a sour taste in the mouths of many RTS fans.

Or Legacy of the Void but if the Terran were reclaiming Korhal.


I don't think you have to pay for the multiplayer, maybe I am mistaken, so only considering the campaign in this review: it's ok. The character dialogue is not my favorite, too cartoonish & lovey dovey if you will. The story has many what are supposed to be emotional moments for characters that aren't developed very well so it doesn't hit at all. There isn't any type of interesting twist either, you basically have an emperor Mingsk like character who turns on you and abandons you, which is heavily hinted at before that ever occurs. A good synopsis is that the story is a hybrid mix of StarCraft 1s Terran campaign, and StarCraft 2s Wings of Liberty & Legacy of the Void campaign. The Infernal dialogue is rather flat IMO, it's like ""Hahaha, PATHETIC HUMANS, you all DIE!"". It may have been better to not have them say anything; IIRC in StarCraft 1s Terran campaign the Zerg & Protoss are totally silent, bringing a lot of mystery into their motives & designs. 

But I do think the campaign missions are fun, and help you get you use to the game mechanics. It took me like 6-7 hours on normal difficulty, so it's not very long but that's to be expected for an RTS. Also, I didn't have any bugs I encountered during the campaign, so that's good!

The game is free without the campaign (which I wouldn't recommend purchasing at $25 without major revisions, maybe $10-15 current state), and balance patches will come with time and feedback, just like every game.

Plenty of these reviewers played the game for 1-4 hours before saying ""wah, this isn't SC2"", and I hate when people do that to games that are obvious attempts to expand on the genre.

202553002,"I wanted to like this game. I really wanted to. I admire the heck out of Tim Campbell and all the Blizzard veterans who made such amazing games back in the day. But Stormgate is just awful.

I will say that the devs' hearts were in the right place while designing this to ""bring back"" the RTS genre. The controls, such as being able to click Q and build something by the nearest worker unit or W to train units without clicking on any specific building, are fantastic. I also like how Vanguard units can subtly level up. That makes it fun to see which units have survived the longest. But that's about the only good thing I can think of.

The genre is bad. I get it that the devs worked for Blizzard and wanted some nostalgia connected to their previous games, but they did it so much there's nothing original to be found in Stormgate. The Vanguard are basically Omnica Corporation Terrans, the Infernal Host are Burning Legion Zerg, and the Celestials are Protoss Lightforged Draenei.

The unit and building themes are horribly inaccessible in my opinion��despite the reused genre ""look"" of the game, nothing looks familiar. It's frustrating to try and remember what an ""argent"" is or the difference between an ""exo"" and a ""vulcan."" At least fantasy has tropes that are easy to pick up, but I just can't believe out of all their options they picked another sci-fi one.

The designers are clearly good at making game mechanics based on their veterancy, but the aesthetics, story, and ""soul"" of the game just aren't there. The buildings all look like circular discs with random wires taped to them to make them look vaguely different from one another (not nearly enough differences silhouette-wise), the voice acting is lifeless, the AI-powered animated portraits are uncanny, and the campaign is boring. I just don't care about any of the characters or the world they're trying to take back.

Overall, this whole game just feels like StarCraft II's step-nephew who has a bunch of wide-eyed wonder and ideas that just don't get delivered. I can't believe this is all they could come up with with 35 million dollars.

202421436,"I am so, so, so frustrated with this.
First off, I backed this game. I was so stoked to hear it was previous devs of SC and WC - these are titans in the industry, no?
But...what happened? This....this is insanely unpolished, and more importantly, the entire game is underwater. I read a post where they basically took in a million but they owe investors many multiple millions. 
I don't understand how they could have let this go so off base. The CEO made a LinkedIn post about it.
There are so many would-be fans who are so angry. The game currently has a mixed review - both overall and recent - how did we get here?
This had so much promise. From the little bit I did play, I would have actually said I could recommend it - if there were some small QoL issues fixed, and the camera not being too close to the battlemap - but people are rightfully frustrated.
I backed it, I got the first campaign (?) free because i backed it, and I am enjoying it. But I can't recommend this game to anyone.
Forecasts indicate this game is dead in the water and servers will go offline within a month or two. If that is anywhere remotely accurate, this game is dead on arrival considering it's ONLINE REQUIRED to play.
When I backed it, I did not know it would be ONLINE REQUIRED to play, yes, even the campaign is ONLINE REQUIRED. 
Know what that means when the servers shut down? It means the game becomes a brick.
No refund.
Nothing.
For this reason, I never buy/play ONLINE REQUIRED games (very few exceptions made).
I just....I'm so tired of shitty studios. This had such potential. This is what you get in 2025 when game development is run by CEO's, project managers who don't know anything, and upper management that fails to have any creativity.
What killed this game is a failure of leadership. The crappy thing is, those with golden parachutes are going to land safely at another company - just so they can screw it all up again - while the actual developers who put blood, sweat, and tears into this, whose passion and creativity were stifled, are going to lose their jobs.
SC/WC team, I want you to know I love you all. I hope you all do well no matter what.
Upper management, this failure is on your shoulders.

202419232,"Everything about this game still feels early access. It would seem like the art, animations, UI, voice lines, story, etc. are still in development, and that the next patch would replace more of the placeholder assets. Except it's supposedly ""done"" and launched into 1.0. What that means is that this game feels and plays like a bad starcraft knock-off. I get that it's ex-blizzard devs and starcraft was the inspiration, but even the characters and story make me think, ""this is the bootleg Jim Raynor on a bootleg Tarsonis."" Perhaps in hindsight, but they should have been a little more daring and not tried to copy paste starcraft because this was the only outcome of it - a cheap knock off.

Aside from the gameplay, the monetization is extremely worrisome. Countless Kickstarter promises have been broken and the game is already stocked with MTX purchases for things like coop commanders that are allegedly still in ""beta."" A third of the game was released under a fake 1.0 launch while the other 2/3 is still in development or ""beta."" Very disingenuous marketing and leaves little faith and hope that Frost Giant Studios will ever truly finish this game. I will be surprised if they even finish the zerg and protoss campaigns before the inevitable black background, white text ""it is with heavy heart that development is ending"" post. They burned through tens of millions of dollars and will most likely move on from this project once they have the bare minimum in the game.

Please mentally add after each con ""... but I understand and appreciate the insane amount of work and passion that went into making this game and there is only so much a small team with limited personnel and resources can do compared to the Blizzard team who released SC2 in 2010. In no way am I questioning the skills and intentions of the dev team.""

PROS:
-Though not a fan of the art style itself, there is no denying that it is coherent and well implemented. The graphics are beautiful, smooth and I think they'll age well. 'Too cartoon-like' was a criticism of SC2's graphic style, and we can all agree that it aged really well.

-The engine feels responsive and polished. Even though I'm still unlearning a lot of my SC2 habits, it should be intuitive for new players. 

-The three factions feel distinct and have a strong visual identity. I'm excited to explore the other two factions.

-I forgot the name of most units, but I really liked:

 The Celestial probe/worker (feels very alien)
 The Celestial scouting cat-looking thing (I like that it perches on trees. I don't remember units interacting with the map in SC2/BW other than for collecting resources and destroying rocks)
 The Atlas (I love its design and that its siege-mode attack can be dodged. Makes you think strategically.)
 The Goliath-like mech unit with a machine gun (I just think it's cool!)
 The Vanguard Capital Ship (It felt amazing to control and loved that it's like a mix between the Terran BC and Protoss Carrier)
 The sword man infantry  and the ranged infantry guy of the Vanguard (I like than both ranged and infantry are available in the early game, and I really like the infantry has a laser gun. Yes, I'm a simple man.)

These are the units that stood out the most to me. I didn't mention anything from the Infernal simply because I did not play them. I did enjoy playing against them a lot though!

-Music is pretty good. The main menu theme does an excellent job of making me wanna jump into a game. The in-game music of the Vanguard and Celestial was good and time will tell where the soundtrack ranks next to SC and SC2.

- A lot of people complained about the SFX and I don't know why! I thought the sound design was pretty good overall.

CONS:
-Some seriously cringe-inducing dialogues which I don't think are necessarily to be blamed on the voice actors. It seems like a lot of important story points had to be condensed and it makes for awkward dialogues and exposition at time. The fact that I played only three campaign missions and cringed multiple times during and between each mission is not good.

-The multiplayer maps feel more like Warcraft maps than Star Craft maps. Of course this game isn't supposed to be Star Craft, but the maps don't feel sci-fi. You know that the setting of SC and SC2 is hard sci-fi just by looking at the maps. I don't really get that here. That being said, I haven't tried every map available so maybe I'll have to edit this point later.

-The art style. As previously mentioned, it's unquestionably well made and implemented,  but I'm just not connecting to it. I prefer my sci-fi gritty and depressing (the original SC totally nailed it!).

Also, this is not a review of the Ashes of Earth campaign, which is a separate DLC (with the first 3 missions free). This game has other game modes that are part of the free-to-play content.

The free-to-play game modes available right now are:

[list]
[*]1v1 Ladder
[*]1v1 AI Skirmish
[*]3-player Hero Co-op
[*]Custom games
[/list]

The 1v1 ladder and 1v1 AI Skirmish play basically the same, where you go head-to-head with one of the three distinct factions, Vanguard (humans), Infernals (demons), and Celestials (angels). The 1v1 AI Skirmish also has a couple enemy personalities to play against, which give some gimmicks and buffs to their base faction. I haven't tried the 1v1 AI Skirmish, but the basic RTS gameplay and the faction design of both modes is good. A lot of elements will be familiar to StarCraft players, but there are plenty of small differences and some new ideas that make Stormgate unique.

My personal favorites are:

[list]
[*]Vulcan mechs that can dash through tree lines, opening new paths
[*]Atlas mechs that walk around on four legs and deploy into a siege mode by squatting (I just like the animations)
[*]Sentry posts (bunkers) that can be loaded with a worker to turn them into repair stations
[/list]

There are some significant improvements to the StarCraft 2 formula, such as:

[list]
[*]Quick-macro shortcuts: makes base-building and unit production easier in mid- to late-game.
[*]Automated control groups: units can be added to controls automatically, and you can customise this.
[*]Stormgates: capture points that give you special units.
[/list]

The faction designs are still evolving, and while it would have been better to release the game in a more finished and balanced state, the changes are going in the right direction and what's here today is enough to create some fun games.

The Co-op is outdated and only gives you a single free hero to play until max level. The other six heroes are free-to-try until level 5/20, then about $10 each. Also, it's almost unplayably laggy on my machine, which to be fair is below the minimum system requirements.

The custom games are created with the editor, which is capable of making regular 1v1/team melee maps only. A few madmen have gone far beyond the limitations in order to create some real custom games, like [i]Stormgate Battle Arena[/i], and [i]Run From Your Doom[/i], which I have enjoyed the last few days. I want to see a thriving custom games scene and that will only possible with the full editor functionality, and a better custom games browser.

There's a notable lack of regular team melee matchmaking, but with the current player counts it probably wouldn't work well anyway. I have played a couple 2v2 custom games and that works fine for me.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]

Overall the game is very rough around the edges (many missing tooltips/explanations, inconsistent framerates/latency, some visual noise / legibility issues, several bugs), and the factions are a bit generic and lacking backstory/campaigns, so I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone in its current state. If the developers can keep the lights on for a few more patches, then this game could really shine. The developers are responsive to feedback, sometimes it just takes a while, as seen during the game's evolution in Early Access.

If you want to try a new Blizzard-style RTS, Stormgate is worth checking out. It's free and getting better with every patch. There is also the Ashes of Earth campaign DLC, which is pretty good, just a bit short.","[{""aspect"": ""Progression"", ""sentiment"": ""Negative"", ""snippet"": ""the entirety of the game is online-only, so any time and money invested could be lost soon""}, {""aspect"": ""Gameplay"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""the basic RTS gameplay and the faction design of both modes is good""}, {""aspect"": ""Controls"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""Quick-macro shortcuts: makes base-building and unit production easier in mid- to late-game""}, {""aspect"": ""Controls"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""Automated control groups: units can be added to controls automatically, and you can customise this""}, {""aspect"": ""Gameplay"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""Stormgates: capture points that give you special units""}, {""aspect"": ""Performance"", ""sentiment"": ""Negative"", ""snippet"": ""the Co-op is outdated and almost unplayably laggy on my machine""}, {""aspect"": ""Progression"", ""sentiment"": ""Negative"", ""snippet"": ""The other six heroes are free-to-try until level 5/20, then about $10 each""}, {""aspect"": ""Support"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""the developers are responsive to feedback, sometimes it just takes a while""}, {""aspect"": ""General"", ""sentiment"": ""Negative"", ""snippet"": ""Overall the game is very rough around the edges (many missing tooltips/explanations, inconsistent framerates/latency, some visual noise / legibility issues, several bugs), and the factions are a bit generic and lacking backstory/campaigns""}]"

202262922,"Yeaaaah, no... This game should still be cooking in the early access. Not be released.

If you wished for some cinematic feeling like in Warcraft or Starcraft, this just has their guts on them, smelling like them but isn't actually them... Its a poor disguise.

I won't mention the ridiculousnes and marketing move to pay for the game and rest of the (only first) campaign seperately.

But i will mention how it requires you to be online in order to play SINGLEPLAYER CAMPAIGN! Also, god forbid if your conection gets interupted cause it will boot you out of whatever mission you were doing and back to the main screen!
It did this to me several times even with my internet being fine.

I do not care about the co-op or multiplayer but i heard that might be the only thing thats actually sort of good and actually thought out.

Im here for the campaign only and let me tell you, the 12 missions are definitely not worth the 24,50� price tag.

I can see the potential it has, the characters, the spirit... but as of now, it falls flat on its face. If you wished for cinematic cutscenes or animated conversations as you could have seen in Starcraft 2, this won't be it. Stills of the characters in dialogues with like 1 or 2 alts for different mood is a cheap move. The whole thing has a very bland and underwhelming tone to it. Ofcourse it ends with a cliffhanger but im sure as hell not looking forward to more campaigns.

The units are recognizable from each other and look nice but there isn't much strategy to what you produce for an army. You can never go wrong with a muderball of mixed forces. 

I appreciate the command limit of 300 but the static defense could use some work.

In the campaign there is also an upgrade table and overall faction bonus table, think? But don't worry, the 12 missions definitely don't give you enough money to buy every upgrade, why would you want that?

For the sound, well, the soundtrack isn't very memorable. Same goes for the units, cause you will always hear only your hero anyway. The impact of gunshots and fighting is somewhat convincing but it could be better.

As for characters themselves, the design has improved since early access. Main character Amara definitely looks and acts as a protagonist now. The voice acting is very good too but the scenes don't let it show enough, as i mentioned before with the stills of characters.

So, i do not recommend it as of now. Either wait for big sale or wait till all the campaigns are out... Or just stay far from this and hope for something better to come this way.

I ignored the initial negatives and bought it anyway, but it really wasn't worth it. It feels like a crappy SC2 mod, and to be honest I bet this campaign will be made by someone in the SC2 editor and it will be better than this.

I wrote some notes as I was playing as I got more and more disappointed:

- Constant crashes (not crashes to desktop, full system locks that needed me to turn the power to my PC off and on)
- No save during the campaign, which I just can't get past. There's even a post by someone from FG responding to a complaint about this and they say that it's only because the game is in early access and will be added in the future :|
- Crashes + No save meant some VERY frustrating missions, kept getting crashes during the same section of a few missions, redoing ~15/20 minutes numerous times. How was it released like this...

- Very distinct unit profiles on the screen. In a blob of units I could only pick out the big stuff like Battleships and Firestarters.
- Very uninspired units for the human faction in the campaign, about 75% have a direct SC2 counterpart, with minor variance.
- Movement is very janky a lot of the time. Units just glide across the ground.
- Why arent unit stats on their card at the bottom? Why the need to hover over the weapon and armour?
- Units creep forwards whilst on defence - this is so frustrating, on heavy defensive missions you have to constantly go back to your defences and move the units back.
- Hero portraits in top right often dont work - heroes dont appear in ""select all combat units"" button , just buggy as hell.

- Saturday cartoon characters - similar to the worst of the new blizzard. The saturday cartoon villains constantly telling us they will crush us and having tantrums over the intercom. Did they not learn that this was terrible from D3?
- Underwhelming, boring story. Basically just burning legion 2.0. The narrative felt all over the place, multiple threads that stopped and started with the ship conversations, very hard to keep track. I still have no idea what the arkulus was, other than a huge deus ex machina at the end. Why didn't she just do that with the arkulus to start with?
- Mostly lacklustre missions which mostly don't showcase the units they are supposed to. 

- Profile missing in end of mission screen, not that I care about storm points or whatever they're called, but they dont work half the time
- AI talking heads, just don't put something like that in, it looks so bad.

- Tedious ship conversations - 2 per char, felt forced, like some corporate mandate
- They were also very janky, another thing that lacked polish and felt unfinished.

As so many others have said, you need a solid campaign for something like this to get a critical mass of people to stay for custom games / multiplayer, but this campaign won't do that.

When people expect nothing less than the next StarCraft, they will be disappointed.
Let's be honest, the game doesn't have the same budget as SC. I think, it's about 10 times smaller, which means no epic cinematics, no top-level voice-overs and so on...

So why play the game? The gameplay is good. The style is actually there, just don't compare it with SC2. It's not completely polished everywhere, but it definitely has its style.

202201737,"[h1]The StarCraft 2 Successor We've Been Waiting For?[/h1]

This review is for the solo players wondering if the campaign is worth their time and money. The short answer, in my opinion, is [b]Yes.[/b]

This is the SC2 DLC campaign we haven't gotten in years since Nova Covert-Ops 9 years ago, just under a new name. The missions are creative, the gameplay is smooth and responsive, and it feels good to play.

[b]The Good:[/b]
[list]
[*]Creative mission design, scratches that Blizzard-style campaign itch.
[*]Super responsive, polished gameplay. It feels good to control the units. Managing the production requires a fraction of the APM that in SC2 (which is very good for the casual campaign enjoyers)
[*]A fair price for a 12-mission campaign of this quality. It is less than 3 eur per mission (2 eur if you include the free missions in the package)
[*]Includes a Steam achievement system. While not as satisfying as SC2's, it's great that it exists and will hopefully be improved and extended to other game modes.
[/list]

[b]The Not-So-Good:[/b]
[list]
[*]The lore is cheesy and half baked. I did enjoy it once I embraced the cringe, though...
[*]The art style has been at the center of the critics. It drastically improved since the early access release but it kept the cartoony vibe that leans on the mobile game aesthetics. Might not appeal to everyone but this was not a deal breaker for me.
[*]Many other modes (Co-op, 3v3 mayhem) are still a work-in-progress or in development. The 1v1 mode is free, so you would be buying this package only for the full campaign access.
[/list]

[b]Verdict:[/b]

202127699,"Idk about the modern technology and the engine used to make this game. As a consumer I look at it and I rate it against what i've played before and how it runs. 
This game looks barely better than a mobile game (even after the lighting update), still looks worse than SC2 and barely produces 30fps on any level of graphics set in the options menu, compared to over 150fps in SC2. Even with the decision to approach the ""cartoonish"" style didn't pay off. WC3 almost quarter a century later still looks better stylistically than this, and we all know why the chose that style - lack of proper talent so it's easier to deflect the graphical quality issue as ""artistic"".
But we all know it's just coping, because if it wasn't, then how come a game produced over 20 years ago and stylised the way it was for technical limitations looks better than the game stylised like that today, when there are no technical limitations? Just have a look at your indirect competitor - Tempest Rising. Both made on UE5, only 1 of those games looks like one (still an average game though).

Side note: 
For the next project or future of current one: Mike, please relocate your HQ to Eastern Europe. Not only you will cut down your overall operational costs by a significant amount, but you will also have access to talent that actually has some original ideas and desire to work to show it and then have monetary reward for it rather than the other way around.

Verdict:

Story: 3/10 - we've seen it before, but there's a way to present it - this is not it
Graphics: 4/10 - it's kinda crisp(now), but it's lifeless. Nothing interesting about it
Gameplay: 8/10 - it's a decent attempt at mixing the pace between SC2 and WC3. This has potential.
Optimisation: 4/10 - you either need to optimise the ""computations"" or make the game look like it deserves the FPS you're getting
Overall: 4.5 - i've definitely seen worse and after the EA release, I did not expect much, yet still got disappointed. The gameplay, definitely has potential and is very evidently been the main focus, however it is very evident that esports was always going to be the focus of it and I just find it baffling that nobody stopped and said: ""Shouldn't we make a game for the normies first and then see how we can make an esport out of it?""

This is a [b] ""Yes, but..."" [/b] review.

[h1] Campaign [/h1]
It's fine...  But nothing amazing.  The story is pretty basic.  The characters are pretty shallow.  And the gameplay of the missions is pretty standard with one or two exceptions.  You have some missions where you build up an army and deathball into the enemy base.  And you have some missions where you control a hero and a small group of units and do little skirmishes.  And you get meta upgrades in between mission to improve your favourite units.  It's pretty standard fare these days.  But I think still worth it for the price if you're an RTS fan.

[b] Positives [/b]
Mission 11 was my favourite.  That had some great environmental challenges and was by far the most interesting!

[b] Negatives [/b]
The quality control on the writing and story was very meh.  A twist bad guy appeared halfway into the campaign, and despite him not introducing himself to the characters at all, they all suddenly knew his name and referred to him as such.  While I, the player, had to infer who the hell they were talking about.
There are also 3 side characters that appear late into the campaign that aren't introduced or referred to at all previously, and the main characters are all like ""Heeeeeeyyy!!!  My best friend!!  I've missed you!!""
And two of the main characters suddenly declare ""I want you in my future"" despite having no build up to it at all.
Lastly, there was quite a lot of ""tell, don't show"" in the story.
[spoiler] At the end of the final mission, Amara goes all super sayan and blows everything up with magical space lasers from her hands in a cutscene.  Instead of having that as a cutscene, give me a super powered celestial Amara that single handedly ruins entire armies with powerful abilities, and then let me play out the final fight against Warz, with all these hugely powerful abilities that hurt Warz just a regular amount.  That would show the power imbalance between these two characters and everyone else around them [/spoiler]

[b] Suggestions for the Future [/b]
- More missions like Mission 11.  Having something unique and interesting about the gameplay.  
- Have longer missions (1 hour?) that have mission objectives that change during the mission.
- Show, don't tell [spoiler] Let me play with an overpowered Amara.  Don't just show it in a cutscene [/spoiler]
- Give me side quests that I have to actually devote time and attention to (more than 2 minutes), and give me a tangible reward. [spoiler] The gun platforms on the space mission are a good example.  More of that.

202048071,"Compared the the EA launch of the game it has made improvements. The vibes of the different factions and tone of the game have been improved upon. The game itself, while better, still has a long way to go and it makes me wonder why they chose to fully release the game with so much of it still unfinished. 

The campaign is so far not good. I've completed about half of it and the story telling is disjointed and uninteresting. I will say its better than what launched at EA but that is setting an extremely low bar. Having the campaign being told in sections of 3 missions at a time with only a total of 12 missions makes for a very short story with shallow characters. They also chose to go with the SC2 model of story telling in between missions and I would recommend they instead follow a SC1 model (Ex. Major characters talk via coms/displays). Instead of having us run around a very uninteresting ship/homebase to have seemingly meaningless dialog with side characters; I'd recommend telling a compelling narrative in a more simplistic way that engages players with the story. I think this would simplify campaign development and allow the voice actors a better chance to shine. 

The true disappointment of this game is the way its being sold as a product. Going the F2P route has clearly angered a majority of the players. IMO, it shows that they intend to milk the player base for future subpar content. I did back this game on Kickstarter and I don't regret my decision as I love the RTS genre. However, I do agree that logging in at EA and not owning everything that was available after spending $60 did sting and left a bad taste in my mouth. 

Overall, I do not recommend this game. The game has clearly improved from its very disappointing EA launch with the factions themselves being more interesting, the look of the game massively improving, and the core gameplay of the 1v1 being better with the addition of Stormgates. However, the campaign lacks a compelling narrative and fails to make the player care about the characters or the setting. The monetization of this game is extremely disappointing and if this is what they consider to be a finished 1.0 released product I do not have faith further content will improve. 

Hope they prove me wrong!

Maybe just spending the resource to unlock new abilities on your characters would be a better fit? 
I never played the old warcraft games so maybe this was inherited from those games.

So If I upgrade the units I have unlocked now; I almost certainly wont have enough to purchase the research tier 4 by the end of the campaign and who knows if it'll be worth saving for it.

201986587,"I've played a little bit of Stormgate periodically since its initial release into Early Access, and have played a few 1v1 games since its ""release.""

I'm a firm supporter of the vision of Stormgate -- WC3/SC2-style RTS with a variety of game modes, especially Co-op campaigns or missions.

My buddy and I used to play Starcraft 2 Co-op every single night. The missions, enemy composition/variety and mutations created a lot of variety in how you would work together to complete your objectives, so after support for SC2 ended, we have both been keeping a close eye on Stormgate's progress. 
It has been a little disheartening to see how priorities have shifted from here to there over the course of Early Access, especially away from Co-op modes and features. It is still unclear exactly what the factions look like in Co-op or if there is any parity with the current campaign/1v1 iterations of these races, but either way, Co-op is on the backburner for now which is unfortunate for players like me.

I think the team's work has been good so far -- they are focusing on the right elements to try to get a dedicated playerbase off the ground, and while I find 1v1 a very stressful proposition for myself, I would gander that many people enjoy playing or watching others play 1v1 matches.

[u]Based off of what I've played so far[/u]:
[u]Pros[/u]:
1. I'm enjoying the overall art style of the game. I think the recent changes to the lighting/graphics system makes the game really pop in certain areas, almost reminiscent a Halo game.
2. There are a number of good changes for RTS games in general here - You don't necessarily have to bind your Barracks to a key, and then start building units. You are able to access all units or upgrades from a few menus with one button, cutting down on the amount of procedural ""busy work"" that you must do with your hands to train units or research upgrades.
3. In 1v1 matches, the Stormgates yield interesting rewards and provide a direct reason for you to fight each other periodically to prevent turtling.
4. I think the Vanguard faction's aesthetic is well-realized, if not very covered ground in several other games.
5. I think the Celestials faction's aesthetics are also interesting and they have a number of cool spell effects for their units that seem unique.

[u]Cons[/u]:
1. The Demon race's aesthetics are just boring. They look like any generic demon you'd see in a child's television show. They seem extremely uninspired as a rule. I'd grant some of the redesigns are great, but it isn't enough. 
2. There should be another batch of missions available before they ask you to pay for more missions. The amount of free content for campaign seems a little barebones.
3. There just isn't a lot here that Stormgate does any better than other RTS games on the market. The Stormgate mechanic is interesting, but the rewards for these tend to yield gamebreaking units/buffs, and the aesthetic for ALL units that you are rewarded after completing a Stormgate all have this weird orange/brown glow. They do stick out, but they look terrible.

[u]Final Verdict[/u]:
I'm still interested in playing Stormgate and WANT it to succeed, but I'm just not the demographic for this game until there is some parity for Campaign Co-op and the dedicated Co-op mode.

It's weird that the game ""released"" when there is an acknowledgement of another full revamp of the Celestials faction, but I'm not privvy to finances and deadlines for Frost Giant and can only assume that there is some internal pressure to gain extra funding/time to work on some of these other features and modes.

It's worth checking out, especially if you enjoy Marines blasting enemies with blue lasers.

201972638,"So, I personally enjoyed the campaign, but there are definitely problems they need to fix.

Problems:

The writing needs another coat of paint. Everyone (especially Tara) is way too cheerful. I kind of wish there was either low morale among the crew or heavy propaganda to set the tone (maybe a mission to secure stimulants for the crew to keep up morale would be fun?). I think Amara would be an interesting character IF she wasn't the main character. Her being the mysterious and untrusting character linked to the opening of the gates, who was only friends with Blockaid would give her a lot more room to grow and be interesting. The infernals�� voices and some of their dialogue are underwhelming. Oddly, in the VA interview, they sounded much better �� maybe it��s an audio effect they added that I��m just not vibing with. Lore-wise, the number of human remnants should be much higher �� at least a few million. It doesn��t make sense for the infernals to bother with mercenaries if they only had to fight a few thousand survivors after defeating a united planet of billions. Finally, the game has way too much strong AOE damage, and the enemy mostly sends units that die to AOE. Reducing AOE damage or adding more bulky enemies would help. 

Positives:

Blockaid��s VA is fantastic. The dialogue is just okay, but the delivery is 10/10. (Not sure if it��s the same actor as the Democracy Officer from HD2, but 10/10). Riker is cool, aside from that bug in Mission 3 where he keeps repeating complaints. Taggart is more interesting than he first appears. If you keep talking to him, you can see how the demons got to him. While it's easy, the gameplay is a lot of fun, and I like the art and look of the game. The robot mission is a ton of fun. Its hard because they attack at 4 angles but I had a blast fighting the BOBs.

Other notes:

I havent played co-op, but it is unclear when and which commanders you have to pay for. I think Blockaid is free? there definitely needs to be a free commander for each faction, and as far as I can tell, only Blockaid is free. Also, for a work-in-progress gamemode, I think more than $5 a commander is crazy. with the pack of commanders ig its cheaper, but if you buy the story mode separately, you miss out on any of those packs, which is really stupid. Finally, idk what social features they've added, but some sort of reward for playing with friends would be smart in the future to grow the game. 

Side note: My bias is that SC2 is my favorite game of all time, and I was NOT a kickstarter of this game. 

Overall:

I think if you are in a place where $25 for about 10 hours of fun and the potential for more if the devs cook is worth it, then get the game. Its free to play and not that large of a download compared to other modern games so I think its worth it to try out for yourself before you commit.

201942924,"If you are a fan of RTS, I can recommend Stormgate. 
For those who want to know if it's worth it? After some deliberation I say yes. 

I came in sceptical, but with a desire to like it. Growing up on Warcraft 3 and later Starcraft 2, I knew I'm gonna play this game no matter what. But now that it has officially left Early Access, the game has to be judged by its merits, not by its promises. 
I paid 25 bucks for the campaign, and I enjoyed it. the first 3 missions are free, and they are quite the slow start, which luckily picks up as the missions progress. You get alot of dialogue with the cast between missions, and they are either hit or miss. It really breaks down whether you like their personalities - and they do have some personalities... just not too much of it. 
The missions are fun to play and decently balanced. I've played it through on hard, and some missions did feel to be on the easier side. If you're a skilled RTS veteran, this campaign is not the challenge you've been looking for. But for everyone else, it's pretty good. 

Alot of the missions draw inspiration from Starcraft 2's mission structure, but the variety is quite decent, so I'm taking that as a positive.

The Dialogue and writing ranges from pretty decend  to flat and monotone. I found myself pretty invested at some parts, just to get pulled out by a lame delivery. I was in love with the storytelling in Warcraft 3 through their missions and cinematics, as well as in starcraft 1 and 2. You won't find that quality here. While it pains me to say, the devs certainly had the desire to create an RTS competitor to take on the titans in the field - but the story doesn't possess the care to detail, I was expecting from former blizzard employees and ""Best-selling writer"". 

I played a few Co-op matches, and while the Devs wish to refine those more, it's playable enough to have a good time with your buddies. anyone who played starcraft 2 Co-op will recognize them all, except you get to play them as Vanguard, celestial or Infernals.  No reinventing the wheel, but fun - with some jank here and there. 

I have not tried 1v1, but it's quite competent and for those who enjoy laddering in other RTS should enjoy their time in Stormgate as well. As to the balancing? I heard from RTS Streamers that it has certainly improved, and that the Celestials got quite the overhaul. So feel free and give it a try, and try not to stress yourself out, haha. I know the feeling of ladder-anxiety all too well. but luckily, there's always co-op mode. 

But it's not all positive. There are still afew bugs floating around. 
The game very much feels like a premature delivery out of Early Access to get another cash injection to keep the team employed and working hard on the game. 
The campaign mode is DRM, so always online, which is quite annoying - and no, you don't get brownie-points for saying ""it will be available offline in the future!""- until it's implemented. 
Co-Op mode is not fully polished. Map-Editor is still in its alpha-phase, and some community members have re-created some classic maps already, like a Free-For-All map where you brawl for supremacy with 8 players. 
I can see the ducttape, i can see the seams, but it's holding together. 

Whether you wish to be as lenient as I, is up to you. You can try the game for free, play the first 3 missions, see if you enjoy it enough to buy the campaign, or one of the other options. 
I hope the developers succeed, I myself made several suggestions in their feedback channels, like adding Lore-texts inside the campaign for each unit at the Unit-console. I WANT to be more immersed in the world, and more invested with the characters, but corners have clearly been cut.","[{""aspect"": ""Gameplay"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""Fun missions with solid RTS mechanics and nice quality-of-life improvements.""}, {""aspect"": ""Balance"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""Missions feel fair and well-balanced overall.""}, {""aspect"": ""Graphics"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""Visuals are reminiscent of Starcraft 2 and look good.""}, {""aspect"": ""Bugs"", ""sentiment"": ""Negative"", ""snippet"": ""Still has a few bugs and janky moments.""}, {""aspect"": ""Monetization"", ""sentiment"": ""Negative"", ""snippet"": ""DRM and always-online campaign feel unnecessary.""}, {""aspect"": ""Nostalgia/DevPedigree"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""Carries a clear Starcraft 2 inspiration and charm.""}]"

Now with the ""stormgates""when one activates, there is a big possibility that the opponents army will be near one , so you can either easily harass the workers/main base or in the late game go into a complete base race. Also a very big MISS on multiplayer - when Main Buildings get destroyed (Command Center, Shrine etc..) and you don't have any more remaining, this doesn't reveal you to the opponent - that means as long as there is a building somewhere on the map.... it can get pretty annoying.

201940527,"Really enjoy this game!! Throws me back to a perfect blend of starcraft 1 and command & conquer. Intrigued me enough to buy the first campaign, and support the devs for future campaigns. Excited for what's coming up next!



**Edited Gripe: The crew is just warming up to you in the prologue. I liked the progression, and them being cold in the first few missions resolves, and dialogue is friendlier and more story relevant past chapter 1.
Almost to the end of the campaign, and I've tried some online multiplayer. The Co-op is awesome!! Gonna have to get my brothers in on it :D

**Mostly came here for a gripe:

One thing I've noticed so far that bothers me, just as a nit pick (and update request, Devs), is that the on ship dialogue with the other crew members seems to punish you for being overly chatty before starting a mission, in the sarcastic way they dismiss you on their last dialogue cue. The biggest reason I find it offputting, at least through mission 3, so far, is that there are chat indicators on the crew that indicate more dialogue. Sometimes there's several cues of story enriching dialogue per crew member, all voice acted very well, but there's no telling when one of them is about to get a little curt with you, like ""why are you still here..."" vibes.

Recommendation: Remove the indicator for the last cue, but still make the crew member chatable. Maybe even loop that if they click them again, but don't try to indicate to me that I should click a crew member, then poke me with akward-ness for sticking around too long.**","[{""aspect"": ""Narrative"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""Really enjoy this game!!

201936992,"As someone who has played an ungodly amount of RTS hours in AoE2, SC, WC3 (my favourite), and SC2, and who has been depressed about the current state of RTS gaming, this game is a breath of fresh air and has the potential to be a light at the end of the tunnel. 

I know that there's a lot of baggage from the botched early release and kickstarter stuff, but I really hope that people can move past that and focus on what's here now. Also, take off the rose-tinted glasses as well and think about the state of WC3, SC, and SC2 when they first released. Good RTS' take a lot of fine tuning and develop over time. They need a good foundation, but they don't emerge as fully-fleshed products. At this stage, what should be the focus is a solid foundation, good principles from the developers, and a fun game loop. Stormgate has those things. It is fun to play and is one of our best shots of having a game follow in the footsteps of WC3 and SC.

High points include: fantastic netcode, good pathing system, races with fun and unique identities to continue developing (definite inspiration from WC3 and SC here), a novel RTS mechanic (stormgates) that rewards activity on the map and reduces macro downtime and turtling, solid unit design that is a fun blend of SC and WC3 principles, intuitive game play, balanced time to kill for units (longer than SC, shorter than WC3), helpful features for RTS newbies (including novel ones like the autobot), mixture of competitive (1v1) and more casual modes (3v3 with HEROES, co-op challenges, custom games map builder).

Low points: campaign isn't going to have the breadth or polish of major WC3 and SC campaigns, 3v3 and co-op modes unfinished at this time, limited map pool in 1v1, custom game maker needs further development and player uptake to take off. 

I recommend that every RTS player try some free games in 1v1 and the free chapters of the campaign at this point.","[{""aspect"": ""Gameplay"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""Stormgate has a solid foundation, fun game loop, unique races, novel mechanics like stormgates, and intuitive unit design.""}, {""aspect"": ""Progression"", ""sentiment"": ""Negative"", ""snippet"": ""Campaign isn't going to have the breadth or polish of major WC3 and SC campaigns; 3v3 and co-op modes unfinished.""}, {""aspect"": ""Controls"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""Intuitive gameplay and helpful features for RTS newbies, including autobot.""}, {""aspect"": ""Balance"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""Balanced time to kill for units (longer than SC, shorter than WC3).""}, {""aspect"": ""Performance"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""Fantastic netcode and good pathing system.""}, {""aspect"": ""General"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""Fun to play and one of the best shots at following in the footsteps of WC3 and SC.""}]"

201912829,"Let's just get to the point here. If you are looking for a new RTS in the vein of Starcraft 2, you will be disappointed. Every aspect of this game feels like it wants to be like Starcraft, but it just doesn't have the polish or the basic elements nailed down. The unit controls just aren't snappy and lacks control feedback, everything just feels very floaty. Units would wander off in the middle of battle for no reason. Chaining subsequent actions and path finding are all over the place and inconsistent. Environmental design and visual cues aren't clear or distinct, making things disorienting and everything just looks smudged together. These are things that were solved 15-20 years ago in older RTS games, but it's reappearing here. How can this be a ""new and modern"" RTS when it stumbles over issues that old RTS games had solved. 

The Campaign is very disappointing. The voice acting are not up to par and the cut scenes were not interesting. Starcraft 1's cutscenes and briefings had less production value but is far more engaging and built a much more interesting world than this game could. For level design and unit introduction, it basically tries to copy Wings of Liberty 1 to 1 but fails to interweave the units into the each mission and story. You can basically complete each mission with just the basic units without much issue. Bugs appear frequently in the campaign, events not happening, missing texts and prompts. They try to add some easter eggs like you can pick up a ball and play fetch with a dog, but the execution is just clunky which just sums up this game perfectly. 

All in all, this game is just not fun. It's not something that I'd want to explore more in-depth and I don't care about the second campaign if it ever comes out.

As of right now Stormgate has 3 playable factions. Vandguards, Infernals, and Celestials. Upon testing out the factions I found out some interesting details.

Vanguards: Can build without losing a worker, Has training time on soldiers, Has to build structures increase unit cap.

Infernals: Building consumers the worker, No training time on soldiers, Has to build structures to increase unit cap.

Celestials: Can build without workers, Training time on soldiers, Immediate army cap set to 300.

Based on just that I discovered that celestials are clearly overpowered for a 1v1 setting. They can increase income quickly and expand quickly. Then build a large force and wipe out the fool who decided not to take celestials.

Ultimately I find myself underwhelmed with the strategy aspect of the game.

201887302,"I'm pretty disappointed and after a year of closely following updates and a little over $100 in support, I think I'm ready to ignore Stormgate until it proves itself.

They repeatedly pitched this as the finalized version of their campaign, and while part of that is their communications team being bad, the other part of that is them telling you to manage your expectations.

To start with the good: the overall RTS gamefeel here is good, everything feels pretty smooth on that front, and the campaign's missions are interesting, varied, and pretty unique. I can see the impact these old SC2 co-op developers have because those also had some more unique mission types and they're swinging for the fences here.

It doesn't always land though. I feel like the game is bad at notifying you of what's going on. One mission to save some people I only ever lost people because I had no idea where to look for them until after they'd already been hit the first time.  In general I wouldn't realize my base was being attacked if I was in battles because the notifications are so quiet and demure that my base would be halfway busted by the time I got back. Sudden enemy waves and reinforcements on top of some poor in-game communication are not helped by the lack of in-game saves, if something gets the jump on you, you better hope you have a decent auto-save. To be fair, that never impacted me, the one time it might have I DID have a salvageable auto-save. But saying your campaign is feature complete and not having a manual save feature is simply wild. And once I beat the campaign? After it unceremoniously booted me out, no credits roll, the game menu said I hadn't beaten the last 3. You're telling me I didn't finish your campaign? Buddy, YOU haven't finished your campaign. It feels like it lacks artistic direction, as the story progresses with very little compelling stuff going on, bouncing from place to place on your space ship around the Earth, making you barely latch onto any stakes and every mission feel anticlimactic as it just cuts to the oddly olive-colored background victory screen and then Amara waking up on her bunk bed.

But all that would be forgiveable, it's an indie studio. I don't envy their task of having to monetize a niche genre with a player base that doesn't want to move on from their classics, so pitching their $25 campaign as complete because they really need a cash infusion is something that could be fixed down the line. 

But it's seeing where the money is going or rather, where the money SEEMS to be going, that is spitting in my soup (This is where transparency from their communication team would be important). 

I hate to continue giving money to a team that seems to be spending it on celebrity voice cast that doesn't deliver. Mercer is phoning in a character seemingly written to be a token Matt Mercer character, Amara is lifeless for the emotional core of the story, Simu Liu and Metzen's characters are barely developed and tbh Simu's raspy villain voice just doesn't land, Tara I think is some Instagram influencer? I'm not sure but she shouldn't quit her day job that probably earns her more than better voice actors get paid for voice acting. 

I hate to continue giving money to a team that saw those AI generated animated portraits and said ""Looks like $25 to me, ship it"". Amara looks like a supermodel when the AI takes over constantly giving a grinning expression as she screams into the communicator and tells her forces to fall back, Ryker looks like a smarmy a**hole both when he's trying to be and when he's not trying to be, it's incredibly uncanny when people yell their mouths open wide enough for the dentist to give them a full exam, and the shoe really drops in the last mission when a heretofore unseen character shows up with AI animated concept art that reminds me of the early days of deepfaking when people made like presidential portraits sing pop songs. 

This was mostly venting about campaign decisions and places it comes short. I played a bit of the multiplayer at launch but never wanted to invest in a constantly evolving meta with updates, as I'm sure a lot of people can relate. I ran through all the co-op missions at least once too. I was excited to mess around in Sigma Male labs as I did a lot of map editing for fun learning basic triggers and how games like this tick when I was in middle school. But the meta isn't done, so it's still not time to care about 1v1. The campaign is kinda bad, so I feel no reason to continue getting invested in this universe, and honestly whenever I check custom games while I'm on I don't see any games listed. And co-op is just, thrown in the freezer for the forseeable future.

Right now, I have no reason to pay attention to Stormgate. I hope that changes down the line, I'm gonna unfollow a lot of the socials and forget about it, maybe come back when the Infernal campaign launches and all my RTS content creators cover it. I'd love to come back and delete this review if they somehow manage it. According to Steam Charts this game has gone from ~100 daily players to ~800 so hopefully an 8x increase in the playerbase gives them the gas they need to continue making improvements. But to me the problem is what I mentioned earlier, the launch of Ashes of Earth feels like a plea to manage our expectations.

201880496,"Giving a negative as there is no meh option. Note I am only reviewing the campaign as I do not play multiplayer and all other modes are not released as of yet. 

Campaign: balance feels all over the place on missions. First few are very easy. I am sure to get into the swing of the faction and units. Mission five has a major flaw which they have not fixed in the past year it has been out. You can build up a full base, max out your army, and research all upgrades before beginning the defense part of the mission. This of course makes it extra trivial. Episode six is still not extremely difficult and has a ""boss battle"", but even on brutal is laughably easy, though at least the team had enough common sense to only take your heroes into the zone. Chapters 2 and 3 have some pretty challenging missions which actually feel brutal defending waves from all sides and then laughably easy and frankly boring missions where you roll around the map with an HQ doing basically nothing until the very end of the mission where you have to hold a point at the end. 

Heroes are a good idea, but make some of the content trivial such as spheres of doom that get two shot by the sniper character. 

Now the hub... in concept I like the drop ship between missions you can get extra lore, and switch out your hero's load outs. HOWEVER, I quickly found myself skipping through even the required conversations as they were one note and boring. Even a ""final stand"" speech at the end of the game which is supposed to be the big ONE LAST CHANCE moment was let down by stale dialogue and (what is beyond me) no music. The equipment system is completed through lockers where you can assign equipment to characters you bring on missions. This is a good idea. However, it becomes very tedious as you have to put the item into the main character's inventory from the stach and put it in the other character's locker. Made even more tedious because she only has 6 item slots which you want to use for her own items. 

Another system is the research and faction upgrades. This system is pretty solid. You have to choose between using resources you get by completing missions to upgrade individual units or upgrade your faction as a whole making heroes and/or units stronger. The issue is that they give you way too few resources. By the end of the campaign you can upgrade one unit out of twelve in your roster (each unit has 3 upgrades) and get the research upgrades. There is just not enough of the resource, perhaps you should get some amount from completing secondary objectives. 

Plot is pretty cookie cutter. First two cinematics hit pretty hard and are decent. Unfortunately there are more than one cutscene. By the end of the game the story is all over the place. Characters are introduced in a mission and then never heard from again. There is a betrayal that has no build up or weight. The third faction is mentioned and you occasionally see units/ghost versions of their units. They are mentioned a few times but no depth to who or what they are. You are just expected to know OH YEAH the celestials. The final cut scene in the game is supposed to be a dragonball z/ harry potter and voldemort duel (you know the one) but is done in a very poor rushed way. 
 
Over all a less than average experience let down by a very obviously unfinished experience. At the $20 price tag, I would say its ok if you have the expendable income. A few missions were enjoyable and brought back the original Starcraft 2 vibes. But over all I felt disappointed at what could have been.

However. To enjoy the full game experience, you would need to spend the original $25 for the base game. Fine. 
-----Then you would also need to spend an additional $9 for each commander beyond the first. Which so far is 5, so ANOTHER $45 IN GAMEPLAY-RELEVANT PURCHASES.
-----The reason for this extra cost is because the devs decided to go with a 'gear' system instead of SC2 coop's prestige system. Each coop hero is playable until level 5. Conveniently, each coop hero unlocks generic gears for use in all your missions, at levels 6 and 7. 
-----None of this covers that their $25 game is a whole like 9 missions or something. Very transparent model for tricking people into supporting them, rather than just making their cosmetics the focus for that crap.

1. The top-left corner of the screen says ""N.106307.Shipping-PTR"", which is fine for early access, but wtf is this doing in a full release? Also, doesn't ""PTR"" means ""Public Test Release""? Why am I part of a public test???
2. Graphical glitch in the first in-game cutscene, where the character sitting on the bed was actually sitting too low, so her waist is clipping into the mattress. First in-game cutscene.
3. When finishing the first mission, in chapter 0, the in-game cutscene shows a Big Bad Demon walking toward your group, making big stomping noises. Well, those stomping noises are repeated on a loop in the post-game summary, very annoying.

Otherwise, gameplay was fine. Story is about retaking the Earth from a demon invasion. Fuck yeah.
Bonus points for main character being a woman, who was a child when the demon invasion happened, and her dad died at that time. Well, her dad was never seen again, so maybe it's going to be a plot twist later?

On monetization, they have in-game transactions. There is an innocent-looking chest icon in the main menu, when I clicked it, it showed me various heros with a price tag. Booooo! Also, I couldn't figure how to exit that menu. Double booooo!
On the other hand, the free version was a good demo to show me that this game needs to cook for longer. So maybe their free-to-play model isn't that bad.
However, after the first mission, I got some bonus ""Storm points"", for ""first mission of the day"", which makes me worried that they're going for mobile-style microtransactions? But so far, all I saw that was for sale was the campaign, and individual... heroes? They looked like heroes. I also saw some premium version on steam, but I didn't look into those.
The prices in the in-game shop were all in real money, so maybe they're not going to be predatory.

201847942,"Campaign:
* Missions are different from first early access version
* I found the campaign fun to play (played on first on hard difficulty)
* Caution: Saves only at checkpoints, no free saving! (so you need to have time for a gaming session)
* Atmosphere especially between missions not as great as in Starcraft 2 but still quite good for game without a big publisher.
Coop-Mode:
* Is a mode where 3 players try some special missions together vs AI. You have in that mode a hero you level up unlocking more units/abilities for the next game.
* I liked it more than the Coop in Starcraft 2 as it had more action and cool customization on high levels
* Game mode is marked as unfinished and it shows on some of the maps which feel more like a tech demo.
* Compared to Starcraft 2 very expensive for what is offered
1vs1:
* Much better and faster paced than in earlier versions
* New stormgate mechanic makes it interesting to try different approaches and timings
Editor:
* only terrain editor part is released but data and trigger editor is planned to be released soon
* so there are no fun custom games yet
* also editor license is a bit strange about requiring only to share the maps via game

Some cautions when buying: 
* First be aware that you can tryout some content without buying anything (e.g. if coop mode is finished enough for you to buy coop heroes)
* Also check what the different bundles contain. I bought the ultimate edition indirectly by supporting them on kick starter and got some further advances from that like being able to play the beta. However if you want to just play the campaign there is now a much cheaper bundle with just the campaign. There were (are?) also some other bundles that they probably just created due to kick starter rewards that contained just some missions of the campaign but not all. They had/have very miss leading names like ""Deluxe Edition"". So I recommend double checking what you get before buying any bundle for this game.

The game has not yet as much content or polishing as Starcraft 2. However unlike Starcraft 2 new content is still being developed for it. If it turns out doing well we might get further content in the years to come.

Summary: I think it is fun to play and am looking forward for future versions of that game.

201832525,"I think the current reviews are, maybe not unfair, but at least based on a past that is no longer relevant. The game, albeit not completely finished, is a very decent modern SC2. The issues player have with it seems to be the very tortured development cycle due to mismanagement and the very confusing monetization. (Although some people are really not trying very hard.)

But, for anyone like me, starting the game now, the game is in a very good state and the business model is very fair. You have access for completely free to the skirmish and 1v1 mode as well as the introduction of the campaign, which is more than enough to get a feel of the game and whether it works for you. Then, you basically pay to unlock content brick by brick ""�� la carte"". So if you find the campaign good enough, you can buy the chapters 1 by 1 or as a whole. If you want to play the hero mode, you can buy a hero to try it, then buy more heroes if you like it. And if you just want to play 1v1s and skirmish, then you are in luck, you can do that for completely free.

Regarding the game itself, the gameplay is really good and the modernization features work well and are really welcomed. The models and animations are... not to my taste and clearly inconsistent, but serviceable. The visuals overall are in a sort of uncanny valley where your brain keeps switching between ""oh, that's not good..."" and ""oh ! it's kind of good looking"".

201827420,"It's a thumbs up from me, despite all the shortcomings. Yes the team over promised / hyped and prematurely released it in Early Access driving a lot of folks away, but at the end of the day what we got is a great looking Starcraft-style RTS with a few notable genuine innovations.

The Grid system for the shortcuts are allows players to macro up without looking away from battles and is very well thought out. It takes a bit of getting used to, but it's worth putting the time into understading it. Right click drag to align units to a path is also very cool.

1v1 and AI Skirmish are fun and probably the most polished area of the game.

The campaign is fun enough, going back for a second play-through on a higher difficulty with a better understanding of the game is a great experience. It does have a lot of negatives however, like the writing being very sub par, with unnatural dialogue and odd line deliveries from the voice actors, particularly the Tara character. The rest of the cast does the best they can with the script their given, but that script is really not compelling. Very cliche story structure, one dimensional villians and there's a lot of ""show don't tell"" rule breaking. That said, the missions mechanics themselves are quite fun and well made.

There's also the occasional bug here and there, and the lack of a Save feature (though the checkpoints are presented often enough), but if you skip the inter-mission hub areas and just enjoy the gameplay of the missions it's a fairly fun experience.

Music is nice, though some tracks feel a bit too repetitive. Sound mixing is currently an issue, with some sounds like when the Stormgates trigger increasing in volume a lot, units not triggering audio feedback on consecutive commands (same with buildings after a few clicks), things like that.

It's a shame we couldn't reach a proper 1.0 release with all factions polished up in terms of mechanics , graphics and complete unit roster, but those that are present are for the most part well done. Unit pathing is generally ok, though not at the level of Starcraft (they have trouble with tight spaces and sometimes get stuck on corners). It doesn't happen often enough to be a real issue, especially in 1v1 and Skirmish.

The game comes with an alpha version of a game editor, which while limited in scope (for now) and a bit buggy it's still impressive what the community was able to create with it so soon.

Co-Op is currently in progress, still using old unit models and abilities but there is a lot of potential here. The game mode itself is quite fun.

To sum it all up, this is great game covered in layers upon layers of issues. If the dev scan some how muster up some additional funding to keep a core team working on it for an year or so, the game can absolutely shape up into a top-tier RTS. Worst case scenario, they close up shop and hopefully grant the community the tools to continue polishing up teh game.

201825756,"This is a hard review to give a positive to, but I will mostly because the game has VASTLY improved to what it once was.

Pros:
-the unit and build grid system macro/micro is very intuitive and when you get going it feels fantastic what you can do with lower amounts of non pro apm. Seriously felt awesome on the later missions with all you can do
- The campaign actually was a little fun (not a lotta) but it kept me interested and honestly it kept me hooked and wanting to finish it 
-The co-op has potential (3 players) I personally value 3 player multiplayer a lot. So this gets bonus points even if not done super well a the moment
- Battles feel really good in terms of speed. Like honestly a fight happens and your units dont get obliterated in 3 seconds (even though I like that sometimes) 
-Missions felt unique just enough.
-Tim C. has nice eyes

Cons-
-My biggest gripe about the dialogue is the fact there is no voice filters, other than like once. Give them a radio/comms sound effect and it'd improve like half the lines of dialogue. 
-The pricing is wack, 9 dollars after tax for a co-op hero is trash. I'm not going to buy that
-bugs, lots of just minor bugs
-I was not an Kickstarter backer, some people got kinda jipped, I didn't though and felt the campaign was a ""little"" overpriced so thats saying something
-the ship segments besides Tara make me want to stop playing
-No mid game saving (wtf)

TLDR: Slash price on everything 20%, Campaign is good, add filters and polish to dialogue. 

If the devs do see this don't get discouraged by SC2 elitists and just keep working. You're doing great

201814223,"I am somewhat worried about the priorities of the devs.

While the cutscenes are nice, if you gave me the option of replacing a cutscene with a mission, I'd replace about half of them.

While having animated portraits when someone is talking is nice, most of blockades' lines are not lipsynced properly, and I would've preferred a static portrait.

I think side content would've been a great inclusion, but I don't think it's possible with how the campaign is structured.

Although I understand that the story can't change on whether you run around talking to people, A CERTAIN EVENT with A CERTAIN CHARACTER is very fucking obvious, to the point that Amara looks like a dumbass for not noticing A CERTAIN DIFFERENCE IN APPEARENCE spilling out from under A CERTAIN PIECE OF CLOTHING, all while they are doing everything short of explaining to Amara's face what they are doing.

I will say that that T.R.I.P.P. steadily going AWOL is very funny, and even if ignoring it is just as unreasonable as it is with THE CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL, it's very funny, and therefor acceptable.

About half of the missions can be relentlessly abused by just spamming hordes of EXOs, as long as you pay enough attention to avoid AOE and dig in on and off for the bonus range. If a dev is reading this, just make dig in take a bit longer, please do not over-nerf the fun out of the game. Oh and please make the third EXO upgrade into something actually good. 25% movespeed slow doesn't really do much when things move as fast as they do anyways. It at most gets the exo one extra shot before engaging or a marginally easier time kiting.

201813302,"The game itself as a competitive new RTS is great, it players faster and is more friendly to new players. When I play it in this fashion it is quite enjoyable. Outside of that it needs lots of work. Co-op and campaign are not ready yet.

They made a co-op mode which I like the idea of...but its heavily based around heroes. I dont really enjoy heroes and would hope they focus on that less in the future.

The campaign is still working though bugs, but also made to feel way too dependent on heroes. Unless the mission is meant to be hero only then my belief is there should be no heroes. The use of heroes in every mission doesn't feel like an RTS and leaves me wanting to go back and play the starcraft campaigns. In most missions I don't feel well taught in what I need to do. I end up just running around killing things until I start making progress. Maybe I am better than I when I first played other rts campaigns but I breeze through the hard missions without even knowing what my main objective is. 

Some other complaints - I don't care to click and walk around the ship between missions. I preferred how SC2 went about the in between mission interaction. Just feels like a waste of time telling Amara to walk around the ship. I think the story needs some work as well. I have not been drawn in to the story and am not feeling for or connected to any of the characters. The way Tara talks and sounds leaves me really not liking her character.

This is basically a review for the campaign. 

It picks up after the first couple of missions with a notable increase in quality and design at mission 7. The plot overall is interesting though nothing really new. The dialogue writing is... lord have mercy. Best way I can explain it is this writing is textbook ""tell, don't show"". It's all fairly spelled out and stilted. Voice actors themselves did great.

As for RTS game play, it's great. Great responsiveness, speed, pathing. It's missing some key hotkeys like select idle military, select military on screen, etc. I do really wish tabbing through unit types in a group allowed you to individually control that group like in AoE IV. Auto control group is fantastic and the advent of automatically assigning workers to build buildings within needing to go find them is a fantastic skill floor-raising feature without hurting the skill ceiling. Mostly just played Vangaurd because of the campaign and their unit roster is good.

The game runs very sluggishly and somehow does not have the ""smoothness of a sc2"" while not having the fun ""jank"" of Wc3, AoE2 etc. The sound design has been bad from the get go and seems not to have been updated much since the first days of alpha. 

That being said, even if one were only to judge the game on what is already included while trying to be lenient and ignore how much is still missing, I still would not recommend this game to anyone in its current state. 

It is kind of hard to review this game on much other than the campaign, given the fact that 1v1 competitive while change dramatically with future reworks and balance patches. 

So the review will focus on the campaign. While there are a lot of issues with the campaign overall: subpar voice acting not helped by a lackluster script, a lot of unecessary and badly delivered exposition between missions, lack of ""life"" in the main hub between missions the overarching and main issue is that the game really struggles to deliver a story and characters one feel any reason to care about while at the same time having missions that are so straightforward/unoriginal and not engaging enough to make the fun enough to ignore the lackluster story/characters that are presented. New players will be presented with a main character who barely seems to care about anything with supporting characters whose only character traits seems to be to deliver exposition. The missions are all standard fare and beyond the very first prologue mission very easy to brease through even on brutal difficulty. If you struggle the lack of an actual save function can be extremely punishing for longer missions where a significant time spent can't be recovered because of the fairly randomly placement of autosave/checkpoints. I won't say it is not decently fun if you really like standard RTS campaigns, but I also struggle to recommend this to anyone given how many better campaigns and stories you can out there, most often for a better price. 

Overall, the main question the developers and this game has failed to answer is ""why Stormgate?"" and I fear that this question will never be answered.","[{""""aspect"""": """"Gameplay"""", """"sentiment"""": """"Negative"""", """"snippet"""": """"I still would not recommend this game to anyone in its current state""""}, {""""aspect"""": """"Performance"""", """"sentiment"""": """"Negative"""", """"snippet"""": """"The game runs very sluggishly""""}, {""""aspect"""": """"Audio"""", """"sentiment"""": """"Negative"""", """"snippet"""": """"subpar voice acting not helped by a lackluster script""""}, {""""aspect"""": """"Progression"""", """"sentiment"""": """"Negative"""", """"snippet"""": """"Higher tier units for all factions are missing""""}, {""""aspect"""": """"Monetization"""", """"sentiment"""": """"Negative"""", """"snippet"""": """"beyond what seems a fairly desperate attempt to secure more income""""}, {""""aspect"""": """"Controls"""", """"sentiment"""": """"Negative"""", """"snippet"""": """"lack of an actual save function can be extremely punishing for longer missions""""}, {""""aspect"""": """"General"""", """"sentiment"""": """"Negative"""", """"snippet"""": """"what is already included while trying to be lenient and ignore how much is still missing""""}]"

201753052,"A Storm of Missed Potential and Mediocrity

Stormgate bills itself as the next evolution of RTS, but what it actually delivers is a bland, uninspired slog that somehow manages to feel both unfinished and outdated at the same time. This game isn��t just ��less than basic�� it��s practically a masterclass in how not to design a modern RTS.

Let��s start with the gameplay, or rather, the absence of it. The core mechanics are mindless, with almost no depth or meaningful decisions. The lack of a proper tutorial is baffling, unless the devs only intended this game for people who already know how to play Starcraft. Anyone new to the genre is left to flounder in a sea of half-explained mechanics and UI clutter. It��s less a learning curve and more a brick wall.

The writing? Imagine a high school creative writing assignment that was turned in five minutes before the deadline. The dialogue is cringeworthy, the world-building is paper-thin, and worst of all, it takes itself seriously. It wants to be epic but ends up sounding like bad fan fiction.

Voice acting is a mixed bag, with some performances standing out only because of how painfully bad others are. ��Tripp�� the robot character, is particularly grating, an ear sore that somehow made it through multiple development stages without anyone saying, ��Hey, this is awful.��

Visually, Stormgate goes for a stylized art direction but lands squarely in the realm of generic and forgettable. It lacks the crisp, iconic look of Starcraft II and instead feels like an asset store demo. There��s no visual flair, no wow factor, just more muddy designs and uninspired animations.

And here��s the kicker, Starcraft II, a decade-old game, is not only free but still miles ahead in every single category, gameplay, story, visuals, voice acting, and polish. Why anyone would play Stormgate over a proven classic is beyond me.

In a market with RTS giants still standing tall, Stormgate doesn��t just fall short, it never even showed up to compete. Do yourself a favor. Skip this empty husk of a game and go play something that respects your time.

The editor after 2 years of early access can only make melee maps. Maybe if they released it with the editor there would be hundreds of custom games and a real player base but they still refuse to just complete the editor instead of giving attention to literally every other game mode.
The co-op mode has only like 3 maps and the commanders are so uninteresting, especially with the 9 dollar price which is even more expensive than the high quality SC2 commanders.
The 3v3 game mode is still not even out so everyone is stuck with the same repetitive 1v1.
And worst of all, the campaign is so underwhelming and absolutely not worth the price.

In a vaccum, I think the reception for this game would be much much better. The big issue is that they promised a bit more than they could deliver at this speed.

But I still think it is really fun and fresh, even if it isn't quite Triple AAA quality. And I am having a great time playing it. Considering a relatively small studio's first big title, it makes me really excited to see what future stuff they work on!

 This scratches that same itch as that I have been craving for a while in a video game. Each Co-Op hero feels unique and has a different type of gameplay. Also, the ability to use items to further customize each faction was a really nice touch.  And I have gotten over halfway through the campaign and each mission has a nice blend of new units, side quests, exploration,  interesting objectives, and good ol' RTS battles. Its a good time.

The game has seen major improvements compared to the initial Early Access release on all fronts, but it��s still far from perfect.

The potential is there, and it's immediately clear that the devs know how to make an RTS. The gameplay mechanics already feel great, with interesting and distinct playstyles for each faction.

201708357,"Ok, so, this game apparently is a SC2-alike game that's based off a kickstarter that made over 2$million in kickstarter money.

It has some ex-SC2 and wc3 devs apparently working on it, and it DOES actually feel a fair bit like starcraft 2, in a pretty solid way. You can clearly feel which team members seem to be there, and which team members or capabilities/skillsets the team may have lost in being an entirely new team, with losing some of those blizzard employees who are obviously very skilled at their craft. 

The character/ship/environment modelling is quite good. And honestly, that's like 80% of what makes a game like this and like Starcraft 2 - good worldbuilding in the form of 3d modelling/assets, etc.

Some of the areas that are really rough and which don't really compare quality wise to SC2 are the avatars/in-game avatar animations when they're talking about things happening with the current mission. it's basically AI-generated slop - and like, older generation AI slop, which makes it worse. Like placeholder static art for some of the characters you're talking to, That said, most indie games are like this so it's not really a huge critique to have that in just some areas. But when it's there, it shows the difference between this game and SC2.

And the ship that acts as your base (at least in the first missions) is just .. basically crap. This may just be based partly on the fact that you can't zoom in, but it really does look pretty awful, like 2004 level quality. Maybe it was one of the first in game assets the team made, i'm not sure. Also, some of the characters in the early missions, on the ship, have just AWFUL voiceacting (it could be done by ai, but it's pretty hard to tell, it's just.. bad). Like you know when a game or a movie has characters or actors that just don't sound, look, or act like they fit the part/exist in that universe? The first missions have that.. in droves. The first few female voice actors, and the doctor. You'll see it when you see it.

I'm only about an hour and a bit in, and it's rough in patches. So far the worst bits (for me) are the really clunky camera controls. You have to really push your mouse to the screen edges for it to actually pan the camera left  and right, which might be good for some players but which personally really sucks. I think there should be a setting for ""edge of screen panning sensitivity"" and panning around with the mouse speed, it's FAR too slow panning around the map. And keybinds for a lot of things basically are completely broken. like if you try to rebind camera up/down/left/right from the arrow keys to say WASD, it just basically doesn't let you do that since those seem to be hardcoded keys for abilities that the game doesn't let you keybind -- an insanely awful flaw, since the game basically thinks it knows how you want to keypress better than you. and you can't rebind say building buildings or whatever to match starcraft like how other rts games often do - a pretty big weakness IMO. Also a lot of the missions and your ship/base area have locked camera zoom levels, which is quite annoying. even if you could zoom in and out a quite small amount would be very nice. The close zoom with the low detail level in the base is quite sucky.

With ALL of that said, it otherwise does feel like starcraft2 and there's a TON of potential. It IS fun.

I hope the team at frost giant well and hope they make a bunch of money. 

I would hope they fix the keybind issue, allow more camera zoom in/out, and maybe spend a bit of time redoing the initial ship that acts as a base, make it larger and less boring, and redo some of the voice acting. Have people at the studio ask people that they think sound good for a specific character if they would record some lines. Don't just use bad voice ai models or record yourself if your voice doesn't sound like it fits the character.

I would also recommend them to try selling or otherwise licensing their engine to other game companies so we see more RTS games in the same vein as SC2 - that's obviously what they're going for and they can make bucketloads of money from licensing. Right now SC2 and stormgate are the only major players in this space but they could make a lot off licensing the engine to other companies that have other ideas for RTS games. Would love to see an RTS made by paradox interactive or different studios with different takes on game design. 

There's almost no chance that anyone at the studio will read any of this but that's my opinion :) If anyone does, talk to your  ceo and try to get them to see how they could make a lot of money licensing the engine. :D","[{""aspect"": ""Gameplay"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""it does feel like starcraft2 and there's a TON of potential.

201707976,"The campaign is very fun.  I'm impressed with how far the game play and story has come along since its initial early access period.

201701390,"After many years and hype stormgate is finally released. So how is it?

In one word - unfinished. It was released that is clearly still a beta build. Many features are not here and are promised in a future being put in ""sigma labs"" tab of a menu but with how game is doing we probably won't get them all and game will die in few months time. I wouldn't recommend investing money in it if you expect to get full experience that devs are promising is coming in upcoming years.

Said all that - it is still pretty fun game. Fundamentals are solid, gameplay is solid, just a bit rough around the edges. Writing this after finishing Vanguard campaign and it was a fun ride. Around 10h to finish it on brutal for a SC2 veteran. First half of a campaign was quite easy but from mission 7 it gets a lot tougher. Story is not amazing main complain being that villains are completely forgettable and not build very well. I finished campaign 5min ago I already can't remember their names. One event was head scratcher that happens right before last mission. It was build up as big deal but it had absolutely no impact on anything so I don't know why devs even included it? But gameplay was very solid, so if you are into mechanics and not story, you gonna have a good time. Overall for campaign I give 2/10 for story and 8/10 for gameplay. 

For 1v1 section, I can't say much. Were is just not enough people playing it and matches are not even. One game you can play a guy who has never played an rts game before and next one you get literally top 10 player of the competitive ladder and got stomped to the ground. Unless we get 1v1 player surge and mmr evens out ladder is pretty much unplayable because matches are just not fun, both if you stomp or you get stomped. But I like that macro portion of the game is a lot easier than sc2. For normal people it is a lot easier. Also were is no such thing as ""I didn't looked at my army for 1sec and now its all gone and game is lost"" as it is in sc2 and I think it's a much better thing. For casual rts players I would recommened stormgate over sc2 if we can get balanced matchmaking.

201684232,"What I've played so far:

Missions 1-3 (Brutal)
1v1 - 10 games (Vanguard)

My Thoughts:
Campaign has been enjoyable so far despite some wonky transitions, Missions 1-3 on brutal felt pretty easy, though there was a large difficulty spike towards the end of mission which was a bit odd (not that I minded). A lot of the dialogue is cheesy, and the animated portraits while the characters speak are a bit jarring.

1v1 so far has been decently fun as a hardcore SC2 ladder grinder, but rollback is a massive problem and has hurt my enjoyment a little bit.

Overall I'd give Missions 1-3 a 8/10, and 1v1 a 6/10 (partly because of rollback, also matchmaking is a bit off)
I've bought Missions 4-10 and plan to update my review later

Try it out, it's free anyway

(Not neurotypical, i mean things literaly if somehow it sounds like it's not)

I think there is a lot to do with what is there, recent updates have been huge jumps forward again and again 

I really like how this game uniquely makes the genra more accessible but keeps the skill ceiling. 
The pace is faster than before i'd say it's a nice rythm, but it's not overwhelming and leaves place for more micro-management of the units and strategy

I'd say it's awesome to learn rts, but it's also made quite a bit of ink flow amongst old school people which doesn't surprise me, it is a passion project

I think at this point it went from promising to pretty fun as it is, although it is still awating more content, which makes me very interested in what is next considering the latest developments (that infernal rework was awesome, really interested in the future celestials!)

The team has listened to their community a lot, many things have changed in ways that correspond to what was asked by players, and i don't think i remember changes that weren't pointed as good, although expectations and criticism go further than that

About the recent campaign, ashes of earth, i haven't done it all yet but for someone who's less interested in the humans i feel invested, the mood is pretty epic and the characters are fun to use. I wouldn't mind a slight supplement of polish in the between missions hub but i'm not really complaining either, i'm already surprised about how much i care about the vanguard's story now

Bonus points for the editor and what the players will make of it, they haven't implemented more than the basic tools and people have already made a moba, wow

[/list]

The developers put a lot of thought into how to make the game easier for newcomers while still not making it boring for pro players.

I can't understand the many negative reviews. The game doesn't deserve that.
Compared to Starcraft 2, many seem to forget that Wings of Liberty didn't have a co-op mode back then, and other features were only added gradually.
And it wasn't even free to play.

I understand that many are dissatisfied with the game's funding model. I think Frostgiant is trying their best, though.
Financing yourself these days won't be easy. Unfortunately, Uncapped Games, another studio in Blizzard's RTS division, seems to have had similar difficulties implementing a viable funding model with their also very good game Battle Aces and had to abandon their game.

I hope Frostgiant doesn't suffer the same fate. The game itself doesn't deserve to be shut down.

201626196,"Original kickstarter here. I chose the Ultimate Founder��s Pack because I have fond memories of Starcraft 1-2 and Warcraft 3. I hoped that maybe the original teams could bring us back to having a modern take on the good old Blizzard RTS.

I have come back multiple times during the Early Access period seeing potential, but always being worried at how rough the edges always were. That��s fine �C you can always sand those down. The devs would show a new graphic pass, or talk about pathfinding, or show off the new faction and talk unit designed. There was promise.

Then the first version of the campaign came out. It wasn��t rough. It wasn��t bad. It was atrocious. The characters were cardboard cutouts, their dialogue was bland to the point of discomfort, the voice acting was flat, the mission designs were generic even ten years ago, and the gameplay was not fun. Units blobbed, unit designs felt uninspired, and the whole thing looked rough.

That��s fine. It��s still early access. Right?

Four missions into the 1.0 release and I have to decide whether I complete the campaign and hope it gets better, or just write Stormgate off and accept that I paid for a dream. Not all dreams come true.

I cannot recommend Stormgate. Other rival projects have had far less funding, have far less prestigious laurels for their roster, far less RTS experience �C yet they are substantially more advanced in both completion status and overall quality. Immortal Gates of Pyre? ZeroSpace? Beyond All Reason? Follow those.

In time I might expand on this review. But for now, I��ll keep it basic.

Units are bland �C abilities, animations, visual design, and dialogue. They��re not interesting to use �C which is so out-of-character for the team who created the literal gold standard in the Craft games. To this day, I still quote Starcraft unit dialogue! Every RTS unit is compared to those and how they felt to use. Stormgate��s units are not cut from the same cloth and certainly not by the same shears.

Sound feels poorly mixed and the effects are the utmost basic. I haven��t even noticed the soundtrack, except for when I turned it down to try to actually hear the unit dialogue. The art style is between uninspired and outright bland. Units don��t actually control all that well �C they have a horrible tendency to clump. What ever happened to all those blogs about pathfinding and control? Starcraft 2 units feel like they clump less. I guess these are kind of similar to Starcraft 1 clumping? Instead, play Beyond All Reason and learn what fantastic unit control looks like in practice. 

But the thing that��s really killing me? The campaign story is essentially non-existent. Yeah, it��s there. But you don��t want to engage with it. It��s boring to the point that cleaning your sink has more drama and intrigue. The first few missions are so poorly designed that I��m having to go out of my way to consider what the developers were trying to achieve with each one. In contrast? Starcraft I��m half-way through the campaign before I even stop to think about that. Even then I get distracted by the dialogue, the story beats, just enjoying using my units and watching their animations. Warcraft 3? No time to think �C I want to load that next mission!

There is no manual save in campaign. Yeah, sorry.

As for co-op? Just play Starcraft 2. No, really. It��s in better shape, despite being left to rot.

I hoped Stormgate could give me an experience similar to the old Blizzard RTS. I would have been happy with a fun time, even if it didn't top the old. I enjoyed Tempest Rising, even if it didn't make me feel how the old C&C games did. But Stormgate? I'm just not enjoying myself.

201621786,"Veteran StarCraft and SC2 player here. Try it, since it is free. Can't really downvote a free game.

[h1]It is so bad though, that I had to write an essay about how bad it is.[/h1]

Just tried it with the ""full release"" and all.

[h2]Units[/h2]

The units lack any kind of character. Everything feels samey. Fights were just a big mess.

Sure you can micro a bunch and stutter your ranged boys or move the rocket cars around, but it never feels satisfying. What units do I even wanna snipe? Even if you are a noob in SC2. Once you see that High Templar storm your bio army you know whats what. And you get excited to try to play around it. This kinda thing never happened for me here.

In most RTS you can mostly guess what a unit does when you look at it. In this game it is just variations of dude with gun. The rocket cars really did not look like they would launch a bunch of rockets. Everything else is just man with gun.

I tried the humans first, but when you see the other races, it is even more of a mess. You don't really get exited to try out any unit. I don't even know how you make a game this sophisticated and still so boring.
It is honest to god a peace of art in that regard.

And the strange unit design. I really don't get it. Why are the spaceships smaller than your infantry men? Makin a big *** Battlecruiser feels fun since you get a big *** Battlecruiser that can make a big bang, but here you get a Tinycruiser for toddlers that moves odd.

[h2]Sound[/h2]

It is basically nonexistent. Just take the Siege Tank copy for example. The real Siege Tank make a big boom and it is so satisfying watching them obliterate enemy armies. And that satisfying sound is a big part of it. The copy just looks like some beetle water-cannon that lobs orbs with barely a noise. They still did some big hits, but it just doesn't feel right without any meaningful noise. That very distinct noise also is a good indicator for the enemy by the way. These things matter is what I am trying to say.
This of course applies to so many other units. Nothing has a distinct sound. Try to remember the gun noise of any unit after playing. You won't be able to. It is all the same. 

[h2]Game[/h2]

I can't say anything of value about the balancing and game design in general, since I really could not get myself to play for long enough. The magic sauce seems to be missing is all I am going to say.

[h2]Story/World[/h2]

And what I saw on YouTube about the campaign was some of the saddest story writing and voice acting.
Tychus telling you that it is about damn time gets you more exited than this whole story-line. Generic evil guys and Marvel jokes. I couldn't care less about this world. So sad.

201620824,"Been playing this game since the early alpha, and I've seen just about as much of its developing process as the general public can. I've also been in the alpha of several other RTS games that are (or were) in development at the same time. (I won't say which ones.) Before this, I played StarCraft 1 and 2 for a good many years. I love RTS games, especially blizzard style ones, so I will be simultaneously needlessly harsh, and strongly biased. Take my perspective with a corresponding grain of salt.  

Of all the games in development that I played over the last couple years, this one always felt the most natural to play. Early on, I had a lot of minor complaints. It felt like ""StarCraft 3 with a new skin"", at first. Nothing more, nothing that made it more interesting or more unique, except for a few solid quality of life changes for ease of play. The campaign felt copy/paste and uninspired, and was full of minor but noticable flaws. The art style, admittedly, didn't appeal to me either, but I was willing to let that slide. Still, though, of all the games I was testing, this one felt the best when it came to actual gameplay. Unit responses were snappy enough, and the balance between passive and active abilities was comfortable for my preferences. I put the most hours into this, because despite my complaints, I had the most fun. The other games may have had more revolutionary concepts and ideas, but this one just... felt more natural. Less time getting used to the UI, less time needed to master each faction's main mechanics, and more time simply playing the game and having fun. 

Fast forward a year or so in development. Everything that I had a major complaint about has been rectified.
The gameplay improvements? Solid. Still feels similar to SC2 in many ways, as one might expect from its spiritual successor, but now it actually feels like its own distinct game. Building on it over the course of the Alpha, the devs have taken a reskinned clone and made it into something that can actually stand on its own two feet, proudly at that. 
The Campaign? Rewritten to be far more interesting. Admittedly, it still feels like I can sum up the depth of each character with one or two words each so far, but the world feels a lot more interesting now, so I actually feel invested this time. Simplicity isn't a bad thing, either, especially if they find interesting ways to subvert expectations (but still keep the characters true to themselves) later on. 
The art style? Redone, and in my opinion it's much, much better. 

It took awhile to get on its feet, but if you're still on the fence, I recommend giving it a try. It's still a work in progress as I write this, substantial improvements are still being made, but I honestly feel like it's absolutely worth playing in its current state. If you liked playing StarCraft II, or if you were frustrated with some recent-ish high profile RTS games where the unit control felt awkward and clumsy, pick up Stormgate. I firmly believe that, as of right now, it is my favorite RTS on the market. There are other games in development that do things that are more uniquely interesting and more revolutionary, and I am extraordinarily excited for them, but if you want to sit down and have fun? This game feels solid. It feels like it knows exactly what it wants to do, and does it well, consistently. And there's more to come!

201617409,"If you paid money for this, you were ripped off. Even as a free game, Stormgate doesn��t feel like a finished product. The fact that this is considered a ��full release�� �� despite the developers openly stating they��re still actively working on it �� just feels wrong. It plays like an early access title, and if I feel that way now, I can only imagine how Kickstarter backers or early access players must have felt before now.

Overall, the game feels like a budget StarCraft II with a splash of Warcraft III. That said, it does show potential. The factions are different enough from SC2 that it doesn��t feel like a direct clone, and there are signs of thoughtful design, especially in the base-building mechanics. For example, you don��t need control groups for production buildings anymore �� constructing units and upgrades is streamlined and can be done from anywhere more easily. Worker units are smart enough to return to mining after building without micromanagement. These quality-of-life improvements are genuinely well done.

But ultimately, those well-designed systems can��t compensate for how shallow the rest of the game feels.

Hero Inventories are too small for how many items they throw at you, some upgrades feel far too expensive for their own good, and the last two missions were absolutely horrendous designs that needed far more play-testing than was given.

[spoiler]The second to last mission is an escort mission: The entire map is a death field except for your movable command center. It cannot carry workers, and demands you to disassemble all buildings when you move your outpost. This includes your supply depots, but the mission has a default value of 100 supply instead of the true cap of 300, meaning when you camp at the final base, the smartest idea is to max out your army with Carriers. Why Carriers? because later into the mission, there are (at least, I was playing on Beginner) two Infernals that spawn extremely out of the way (like, 1/4th of the map level of distance) and prevent the objective from progressing, but if you leave to go kill them, Infernals will attack and kill the objective. Better hope you built Carriers because nothing else can survive the trek to them and back. Oh, and if you're supply-capped because you built Carriers earlier and your workers died, you can only repair the main objective with consumables you get from other missions.[/spoiler]

[spoiler]The last mission is a Death March. Aside from an awkward barrier set up in the top left corner to prevent you from progressing (points to the bad guys for putting the batteries outside of your range for the first time in Gaming History) you're expected to attack towards the top right of the map. All the while, you are being absolutely POUNDED by the heaviest units in the game. Being on Beginner however, I didn't have much problems killing them. There's also a lot of resources on the way, which leave you a sitting duck, but can also help you rebuild your forces. When you can have three maxed-out bases worth of resources, you'd think the best idea would be to make a 300 max supply army right? Well on Beginner, the mission ended when I actually got to the Top Right. I wasted half an hour building a 300 supply Carrier Army for absolutely nothing. I'll note this mission ALSO has 100 base supply, AND requires researching unit upgrades... On a Death March...[/spoiler]

I also had the false assumption that there'd be some kind of NG+ when I completed the campaign... like, I'd get to keep all of my upgrades and farm credits for everything I didn't get, essentially bringing new replayability.

201615180,"As a long time fan and player of popular Blizzard RTS games, I have been waiting and hoping that someone would develop an RTS that scratches that same itch that Blizzard has left lingering in the community for a long time!

Unfortunately, after a really disappointing Early Access release, and a still disappointing ""Launch but not launch I guess???"" I've found that I am still waiting.

I really wanted Stormgate to knock my socks off, but now it feels like the game is a cash grab for backers and for those that will spend money in their store, which should not be in the game right now anyway. Frost Giant keeps emphasizing on the fact that they have a really really long time until the game will be ready for launch, if this is the case, I think they need to take this off the storefront and complete the damn thing first, then release it...

After the updates, there are slightly improved graphics, the environments are still bland and not super exciting or creative, character model changes, and some other little things here and there. I can appreciate that the B.O.B.'s are gone and replaced with a new harvester unit, the B.O.B.'s just felt so dumb and out of place. The game feels a little more serious, and that's a positive thing.

Stormgate is not the RTS that scratches that itch. Frost Giant has really screwed up on this from the get go, first impressions matter, and their first impression when putting this game into our hands absolutely soils their reputation. It feels akin to Back 4 Blood touting that it was developed by the creators of Left 4 Dead, then they just couldn't live up to their past projects... I'm sure many people will do the same as me, and just wait and watch. I have other games to play that actually keep my interest.

I really want this game to be great, but it sure as hell isn't there yet. Don't buy anything in this game, and don't purchase anything other than the Free To Play version, it's sooooooo not worth the money you'd give them.","[{""aspect"": ""Nostalgia/DevPedigree"", ""sentiment"": ""Negative"", ""snippet"": ""As a long time fan and player of popular Blizzard RTS games, I have been waiting and hoping that someone would develop an RTS that scratches that same itch""}, {""aspect"": ""Monetization"", ""sentiment"": ""Negative"", ""snippet"": ""it feels like the game is a cash grab for backers and for those that will spend money in their store, which should not be in the game right now anyway""}, {""aspect"": ""Graphics"", ""sentiment"": ""Neutral"", ""snippet"": ""After the updates, there are slightly improved graphics, the environments are still bland and not super exciting or creative""}, {""aspect"": ""Gameplay"", ""sentiment"": ""Negative"", ""snippet"": ""Stormgate is not the RTS that scratches that itch""}, {""aspect"": ""General"", ""sentiment"": ""Negative"", ""snippet"": ""Frost Giant has really screwed up on this from the get go, first impressions matter, and their first impression when putting this game into our hands absolutely soils their reputation""}]"

201612313,"It's a fine game. So far, nothing really especially attracts RTS gamers aside from the snowplay engine. However, potential is still there. It seems they have been forced into this ""under-cooked"" release due to monetary/sponsor issues. Right now, everything aside from the campaign is still ""under-cooked"" by a significant margin.

For fans of RTS single player experiences and $25 isn't much to ask, I think the campaign is still worth it for you to play. Otherwise, keep this game in the back of your mind for the future (Probably minimum 6 months). Some notable future features:

1v1 - This is *mostly* complete. I can not say it's complete until they are finished with their design for the celestial faction. However, it is servicable at the moment.
Stormgates - Hence the game title, this is a feature in 1v1 which is an ""upgrade"" to the creep system. Very rough right now, but it has potential.
Editor - They have invested quite a bit of time into the editor. It seems like it still needs a bit of work, but soon the community can develop loads of cool custom/arcade games.
Co-op - This seems to be far out (~6 months to a year) atm for their official re-vamp. But, assuming they don't screw it up, this will be the closest to an ""upgrade"" and ""still-serviced"" co-op mode from SC2. It is also 3-player, which may fit some people's niche.
3v3 - Their yet-to-be-revealed Moba-esque-but-still-RTS pvp mode. This likely going to be released around the same time or soon after the Co-op re-vamp. The most uncertain mode so far, but also the area where they likely have the most freedom to innovate.

Edit: After reading other's reviews, I have come to the conclusion maybe 60% of the negative reviews should be on the paid game-editions (Basic, Deluxe, and Ultimate editions, translated from their respective kickstarter backer rewards) -- and understandably so. The developers over-promised and under-delivered on what they put out there upon the announcement of Stormgate. The extra (read: discounted) content in the kickstarter backer rewards was/is mostly aimed at the Co-op heroes, which currently do not have release-ready content and likely won't for at least months!

Right now, any of the higher-tier edition upgrades are a BAD DEAL. It's a free game to try out.

201611595,"Out of nine of the twelve missions I've played 9 were enjoyable, from what I've seen of 1v1 it looks good there may need to be some balance patches from what I've seen I have not tried yet.

Glad they kept it up its forming into the game we all wished for!

Above is positive review below is what the game feels like after some more time.

1v1 - cant get behind or feel a connection to any unit just have more than the enemy and a-move for victory. All other RTS games you can make a connection to units as they are good at what they are meant for. Stormgate is the opposite just make anything and swarm them healing is way to strong.

Campaign - last three missions were meh at best the entire story was OK but couldn't relate to anyone and all the ""heroes"" didn't feel like they cared about what was happening in the game or cared too much to the point of cringe. If you want to learn the lore you actually have to load up the mission and are playing a mission just selecting upgrades for units progressing the story, there was a time where the game was the game and you select unit upgrades maybe play a mini game before actually starting a mission. When talking to people in the campaign you lose control whenever you click on someone which doesn't center the camera to where you are.

There are more issues that I am not stating as it will take too long to write out all my gripes with the game, but I will state the graphics has VASTLY improved but are still not perfect.

They need to put this back in the oven before coming to early access, if they released this game in this current state last year and spent another year fixing all the issues with this current release I would have hope for this game, instead this is the ""release"" which is extremely lack luster.

201610436,"Wow...we have come a long way since early access began. In just over a year, this game has received a massive glow up. Just about everything is in a better state. The campaign is actually fun, looks great, and even offers some cosmetic reward unlocks for beating certain missions on brutal difficulty.

Don't listen to people here who say that they supported this game on Kickstarter and are now being scammed because they only received the first 3 campaign missions. Let me tell you as someone who ALSO supported this game on Kickstarter, each support tier's rewards were clearly spelled out. People who only have access to the first set of missions only bought the first set of missions...

The monetization strategy in this game is totally fair. You can buy the full campaign, access to the Coop commanders (for a mode that is very much still a WIP), and cosmetics.

- First of all, that 1.0 is not the 1.0 most of the people think. It's the 0.6 version but Frost Giant decided to make a huge leap from 0.5 to 1.0
- The content in 1.0 is abysmal and not worth the investment. You have only 12 single player missions from Vanguard faction, 1v1 ladder and that's all. No coop at all but of course, Coop Commanders can be still bought with a promise of finishing the Coop
- For a price of 65$ you get only 10 hours of Single Player content. These twelve missions will take you less than 10 hours to complete a campaign.

However, the biggest offender for me to not support this game anymore is Frost Giant's practices towards the consumers. They treat them like bottomless pits of money.
- The leap from 0.5 to 1.0 was a weird move with hope to get as many players as possible for a full launch while in reality it's the 0.6 from old roadmap
- Devs (including their CEO) were writing fake positive reviews, but got caught
- Ninja Kickstarter quick edits to change some information to avoid being caught with false premises
- Such one promise for example was an exclusive access to the beta in 2024. Just before the beta, Frost Giant decided to throw the beta access for on STEAM, for a price cheaper than those backed it on Kickstarter
- Really poor communication and confusion with bundles. Which one should people buy to get full access to the campaign

Also, please don't use Early Access to start it with tech demos without content. 0.1 had the highest amount of players and it scared away many people for good because how just empty that version was. In 2-3 hours you were able to see the whole content. Seeing how short that game is in 1.0 release, no wonder it does not have many people.","[{""aspect"": ""Monetization"", ""sentiment"": ""Negative"", ""snippet"": ""They treat them like bottomless pits of money.""}, {""aspect"": ""Progression"", ""sentiment"": ""Negative"", ""snippet"": ""For a price of 65$ you get only 10 hours of Single Player content.

201585449,"Every aspect of this game feels like it was made with arrogance that hit a reality wall. Like a studio that saw themselves as AAA and didn't care the resources weren't there to support it. Everything could have been a lot better if they had been smarter, leaner, and more focused. Some examples.

--Very little explained in tutorial or UI. Honestly, without having played Starcraft, how would anyone know what Supply Blocked means? Or how about explaining that not all units can target flying enemies? Who wants to essentially softlock themselves in a match by needing to learn-as-they-play? Who wants to spend time researching units before they actually play? (Some, but not enough to sustain a healthy playerbase.)
--Top-tier actors (Simu Lu, Matt Mercer, etc.), try their best to jazz up a bland story of confusing characters, and typos all over the place, often with weird bouncing animations on the talking heads and out-of-proportion conversations.
--Major bugs (e.g. boss had 0 HP and when dying wouldn't trigger the final cutscene.)

The MOBA took over from the RTS because the MOBA concentrated multiple branches of mechanics into a single type of combat that was simple-to-understand but hard-to-master. This game could have taken a similar approach of simple gameplay with complex decisions, but the game focused on nostalgic/outdated designs instead. I think in their ex-Blizzard arrogance, they strove for AAA goals with very little thought on how to adapt for an indie budget or modern tastes. Sometimes people fail upwards. My guess is this game won't be here in a month.","[{""aspect"": ""Gameplay"", ""sentiment"": ""Negative"", ""snippet"": ""Very little explained in tutorial or UI.

201584373,"So this is an update to my initial review which was as follows:

""Great can absolutely recommend! I first took a look at this about a year ago in early access and it felt clunky and not optimized. Now I'm 2 missions into the campaign and having a blast - feels really great!""

Since then, I have purchased the campaign and coop commanders and played about 14 hours in total. 

Campaign:
Pros
- Starts of really strong and is also what got me hooked into buying the rest of the campaign
- Heros with interesting skills and equipment, Tech and research tree in the base hub, good voice acting and characters
Cons
- Ball of death can always win, you never need to use special unites which you just acquired to complete missions
- no tutorialisation of what buildings or unites you have or against what unites you are fighting against - I still have no clue what enemy unites or buildings there are, I just need to send in my ball of death and destroy them.
- Later on some missions are just annoying and not fun. Spoiler! [spoiler] Mission Dead Reckoning with the contamination zone just feels really tedious and annoying. Always having to wait for the drones to give you a safe area from the radiation. Also you need to explore and salvage resources but have to wait for the drone cool down from the command center. Also need to move your base with all unites close to it to other resource sites and it moves really slow. [/spoiler] 
- Upgrades from the techlab does not really feel impactful. The Research station uses the same currency which is a shame   as one could use research knowledge and the tech lab could use credits or tech scraps. You have to play the campaign more than once to unlock everything. I like having to decide how to have to spend limited resources, but the decisions are not impactful. Way would I want to play a story campaign several times to unlock everything? 
- campaign kind of really drops of towards the end and was somewhat forgetful, and the last missions felt like ""okay I bought this so I��ll finish it""

Coop:
- difficulty has no real impact, ball of death wins in almost every case no matter if hard Brutal or annihilation.
- Hero upgrades don't seem really impactful. When levelling sc2 commanders in coop i would often really anticipate unlocking certain skills at certain levels, but here it just has little impact. 
- I like the idea of hero equipment and loadouts, but since it has little to no impact why would i care?
- Coop with three players is a nice change, but 2 player coop would be nice as well. Finding a coop buddy in sc2 was really nice but having to plan for three people is just again - tedious

I really want to like this game, it has  some really nice ideas, but as of now it just does not expand on them enough and just feels a bit boring :(","[{""aspect"": ""Gameplay"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""Great can absolutely recommend! ...

201580622,"imma keep it real with no dickriding or glazing, I have been following the progress of this game since its announcement, and I must say that, despite the rough early access launch last year, the game has made some improvements. The developers are actively working to fix past mistakes and are listening to player feedback, which has greatly contributed to the game's current state compared to a year ago. Although some promised features are still missing, I believe that if the developers maintain this level of consistent progress for another year, the game will reach its full potential. In the meantime, I encourage you to try the first three campaign missions and experience the three races in a 1v1, AI skirmish, or cooperative mode. This is all available for free, so you can get a feel for the game without any obligation. If you don��t feel that special connection to the game right now, it might be worth stepping away and checking back after a couple of patches (which are released every two months). You may be surprised by how much the game has changed by then, especially now that Team Mayhem, relaunched COOP and a fully functional editor are on the horizon.

201578908,"Story is really bad, the dialogue somehow is worse. If an A.I was asked to write a dialogue between teenagers working somewhere it would be better than the script the game has. The visuals are pretty however the designs for units, heros and buildings is bland and lazy. There are a couple of useful control features you can customize which might be helpful to some but the gameplay itself is boring and nothing compared to what it tries to be, Starcraft.

>This is not a spoiler since it's the opening cinematic for the campaign<

A group of humans survive and escape the ""hell"" gate opening on Earth, rebuild their forces in 15 years to liberate it. And they return and keep repeating ""we were not prepared to what was waiting for us"" ""we did not expect it to be like this"". yes they did not do any research, did not probe or scout, they just YOLO back in and the first thing you have to do is go back to a facility where there was a ""key"" and bring it back, not knowing if said facility exists anymore after 15 years or even thinking the key would still be there because it's important. I really need not say more on how little thought went into the plot and I do not want to go into the cringe, awful dialogue there is.

The only partial saving grace the game has is the visuals which aren't that bad but most of the units and buildings feel like placeholder objects and unfinished, to sum it up they look bland and boring. Not to mention the hero units look at best acceptable for a mobile card game.

201571339,"This game sucks, I paid for early access, turned out to be unbalanced nonsense that was barely playable as Infernal because somehow the devs forgot to make it possible for melee units to actually be able to touch ranged units. We got the early version of the campaign and it was laughably bad graphically, poorly written, and a second rate clone of Warcraft 3. The general game design was boring af for the individual levels too, you just sit there spamming units and a-move, no micro or anything required. So now we get this newer reworked version of the game and hey at least Infernal APPEARS to be playable, they gave their units speed buffs and seemed to have generally increased their damage as a whole which is nice.

The campaign is still a piece of shit, again poorly written, some very obvious and awkward exposition dumps for world building. The main character is boring, she's just a ""good person"" and they force you to sit through these boring ""gameplay sections"" where for some reason you have to keep going back to your main base and talk to NPCs instead of doing what you wanna do in an RTS game. You know, at least in SC2 it's a faster process just clicking through sub-screens in your hub base and you can ignore most NPC interactions if you want to. In here they make you walk from one room to the next.Again, storyline is a knock off of WC3, clearly cloning the arthas becoming corrupt storyline. Also this games over-reliance on esports and starcraft nostalgia is seriously fucking old now. I love starcraft but this game has no identity of its own, and the constant callbacks are tiring. They even do this disgusting animated portrait for main characters in the campaign where it's OBVIOUSLY AI GENERATED and appears to be calling back to SC1 animated portraits with the psuedo-crt look and delayed mouth movements that are poorly synced to the voice acting.

As a big fan of RTS especially Warcraft III, this brought me back to the Frozen Throne Night Elf campaign, blinking everywhere trying to find all the secrets. 

Its free so I would highly recommend any RTS fan, especially WC3/SC2 fans to give it a go. Why not?! The game play is smooth, unit designs are interesting and they've got some cool UI features like the hotkey/command card setup. 

Now the negative. I've only played 51 minutes in the campaign, and I've already been disconnected twice! Oddly both times were when I was running around the ship (the hub where you select your missions and item load out etc.). I'll give them the benefit of the doubt as the game just got released, but if I was playing PVP and getting disconnected frequently, that would definitely be a deal breaker.

Early access was rough. Questionable art direction,  mechanics that were simply not fun, janky unit movements and lag issues in an RTS...
But then again, IT WAS Early access. Yes, maybe a little bit to early but here are the results now. They listened to feedback and made the changes that were necessary. 
Art direction now is darker, more mature and in line with what you expect from SC2 devs
Got rid of the annoying creeps camps and replaced with  way more interesting storm gates that spawn randomly, giving you an incentive to get on the map
Unit movement an pathing y sooo much better, not perfect, there is some work still to be done here but its really good.
No lag, delay or anything like that, really smooth experience.
Focusing on the campaign and 1v1 was a tough but a correct call. Lets just hope that the missed first step did not kill the chances of this great game to live on!

But it's a free to play, right? That's the deceptive part. It's free to try, very much like Starcraft 2, but if you want to actually fully play the game, you need to get out that wallet, and when you do, expect to take a fucking dent out of it.

Sure, you could piece meal, that's what is encouraged. But the first campaign, then there'll be a second and a third campaign you can also buy down the road. Buy a single coop commander, but if you want to play any of the rest of them to max level you'll be paying for those individually too. But everything that is available right now, for the low low price of $65. That's right, you too, if you act RIGHT NOW, can lock in this AMAZING low price for basically an early access game! Fomo bullshit.

Did I mention the ""pay for everything"" option has already changed what you get since it's inception? Classic ""buy everything"" option being better the longer you wait. When will game studios realize that if you give players the option to ""buy everything"" it needs to include EVERYTHING as in all future content. People will pay a $100 easy for that, but instead they drip feed content and want to charge full game prices.

It's like they don't realize how many amazing $6, $15, $20, $35 games exist out there. Games that will give the player thousands of hours of play.

pros:
- Frank Klepacki music
- improved, clean-looking UI
- smart 1v1 AI

cons:
- awful voice acting and dialogue
- lame pixar characters + story
- awful sound FX + sound mixing
- cutscenes that barely rival wc3 in quality (a 20 year old game)
- FG staff fake-reviewing their own game, deleting negative comments, ignoring negative feedback (negative feedback is still feedback)
- uninspired and wishy-washy race design. the vanguard are the chatGTP race and the demons are like a kintergarden-friendly version of Diablo units
- sketchy monetization
- absolutely abysmal level of polish for a $40million dollar game

mid:
- nothing ground-breaking about the 1v1 mode. the stormgate mechanic as it is currently implemented is boring, but has potential

overall impression:
agonizingly bland and disappointing end of a game that could have been great. where did the $40 million dollars go? a rock-climbing gym, sleep pods and massage chairs for their orange county studio?

201530641,"EDIT: they fixed the bundle issue yippee!

First off, for anyone saying the only way to get the whole campaign is in the ultimate bundle. There's is a $20ish bundle in the in-game store which has the whole vanguard campaign. It's not on the steam page cus steam only allows 3 bundles apparently.

Okay, actual review time. I've been following this since the alpha. And let's be honest EA was a mess. The game has come a very long way since then. Is it perfect? not at all, but the amount of improvements and work that has been done should be recognised. The editor wasn't slated until 1.0 so that fact we even have one is crazy and the community has already built a bunch of exciting things it.

Game play wise, it's one of the more robust of the new RTS' out there. Path finding generally works as expected, auto hotheys are a GODSEND and it handles well. The time to kill is still long. It's not as long as it used to be, and stormgates add a nice explosive and interesting edge to the game.

Gameplay:
The core RTS mechanics are tight, fast-paced, and rewarding. Each faction feels unique with distinct strategies, and the learning curve is just right �� easy to get into, but with deep mastery potential. Micro matters, but macro wins games, just how it should be.

Campaign:
The single-player campaign is way more fleshed out than I expected for a free-to-play title. Great storytelling, high production value, and fun mission variety. The co-op missions are a blast with friends too �� super replayable.

Multiplayer:
This is where Stormgate really shines. Ranked matches are intense, and the matchmaking feels fair. The devs have made a clear effort to support competitive play without alienating casual players. Plus, no pay-to-win nonsense �� just skill and strategy.

Graphics & Performance:
Looks fantastic without frying your GPU. The art style is sharp, animations are smooth, and performance has been rock solid for me. Also, major props for the clean UI.

Dev Support & Community:
Frost Giant is doing everything right. Transparent updates, active feedback loops, and a passionate community that genuinely wants this game to succeed.

201517744,"Would I recommend it? Yes, but with some caveats. It's campaign is functional, and massively improved from what it was. Is it as good as any of SC2's campaigns? No. Is it as good as WC3's campaigns? No, but the upgrades and research are kinda fun, and having a stash is nice. Team versus? No, that doesn't exist still. Co-op? It's okay, but I had hoped this would be more polished by now. 

I'm still not going to actually tell my friends specifically about stormgate at this point, since we're not versus players these days, and I want to be able to hop into games they'll enjoy with them. That means 3v3, 2v2, and co-op. Co op is better than it used to be a year ago, when they last played and got burned out quick, but it needs a lot of work still. The levels come too slow and most of the commanders don't feel fleshed out yet. 

Warz doesn't take off until later levels, he doesn't feel unique from Maloc at first. Maloc's feel doesn't match his aesthetic. There's no bonuses for burn damage and bonuses when burning enemies or burned ones are near or stuff like that (Warz has this with infest which is nice! But again it comes too late). Blockade is actually an EXCELLENT starter hero with great starter gear. Yet, he's going to really shine in a more defensive mission, and there isn't one really. Infested Hives is closer, but even at A4 difficulty the nights are pretty easy. Also Blockade doesn't feel very distinct from Amara. It's like Amara is trying to be the mech hero, and blockade the bio one (due to the gear and combat medics), but it doesn't really work and we still need a proper mech hero. Meanwhile Amara is kinda OP, which I love, I just wish the rest of the heroes reached that point as well. Rhykker is good! No notes there. I like Kastiel, but Auralanna still is just the worst. I levelled her AFK because I just couldn't stand her, and this was after they buffed her slightly. It's clear she's meant to be a support hero, and that would be cool if she was able to function at least passably on her own. But she's not. Kastiel is great though. No notes there. 

Okay, so, given that, why would I recommend this game? Well, because it's free. For a free game, it's not bad, and it's a lot better than it used to be. I think you could have fun in co-op with just Blockade, and the first six missions of the campaign are okay for a single playthough. I wouldn't recommend paying money for the rest of the campaign at this point, and you definitely shouldn't pay money for Auralanna (can you imagine?). But, you can have fun with the other commanders, I just would pick your favorite, and while Maloc is viable, I don't think he's on the same level as the other commanders. So, Warz if you like infernals, Kastiel if you like Celestiels, Amara if you like Blockade's playstyle but want more power, Rhykker if you like dogs and being OP. At this point I don't think there's enough co-op content to justify buying multiple commanders unless you're really enjoying it, and you appreciate the gear system.

As for versus? I dunno, people say it's okay. I played a bit and asked myself why I was doing this. I'm not 21 anymore, I'm not into it. It's not my thing. But if it's yours then I hear mostly pretty good things about it. 

Honestly, the game does have potential. I'm hoping somehow launch gets enough players that they can survive until they have co op and 3v3 working as intended.","[{""aspect"": ""Gameplay"", ""sentiment"": ""Positive"", ""snippet"": ""campaign is functional, and massively improved from what it was""}, {""aspect"": ""Progression"", ""sentiment"": ""Neutral"", ""snippet"": ""the levels come too slow and most of the commanders don't feel fleshed out yet""}, {""aspect"": ""Balance"", ""sentiment"": ""Negative"", ""snippet"": ""Amara is kinda OP, I just wish the rest of the heroes reached that point as well""}, {""aspect"": ""Monetization"", ""sentiment"": ""Negative"", ""snippet"": ""I wouldn't recommend paying money for the rest of the campaign at this point""}, {""aspect"": ""Matchmaking"", ""sentiment"": ""Neutral"", ""snippet"": ""I want to be able to hop into games they'll enjoy with them.

Worth trying out and playing it. A passion project worth supporting.

I've been following Stormgate closely since its inception and supported the project from the very beginning on Kickstarter. While I haven't played a lot yet and honestrly I am just a casual player, what drew me in (and still keeps me believe in this project) is the passion behind the idea: a group of developers going their own way in order to cut any corporate approval chains to create a new RTS experience, and openly sharing that their goal is to compete with the best in the genre��StarCraft, Warcraft, Age of Empires.

As someone working in IT and product development myself, I think the early access release did exactly what it was meant to: open the doors for brute, unfiltered community feedback. It's clear to me that Frost Giant certainly expected strong opinions and decided to go from them them considering the cost (hopefully in the short term). There��s no other reason you'd release such an early version of a game unless you truly wanted the community involved from the ground up. And in my view, I appreciate that transparency. It was a bold decision and there was nothing different to expect, a hard hit back. 

In the past the popular RTS titles were often polished over years before launch, but this is not the case anymore. The Industry has changed. Games are expected to deliver much earlier, while players still expect a full, finished product. Balancing that is no easy task.

I'm not a competitive player. I mostly enjoy campaigns (played both old and new version and of course I am happy with the updated one), co-op, and casual skirmishes with friends. And even in its current state, I'm enjoying the game and look forward to continuing with it. The innovation in faction design and UI/UX is particularly interesting. I find it natural to spot similarities from classic RTS titles, and that's expected in such a mature genre.

I'm especially eager to see what 3v3 team-based modes will bring, as they seem to promise a new gameplay experience within the RTS framework.

On monetization: let��s be realistic, this is part of the entertainment industry. Everything we enjoy comes at a cost. Whether it's renting a soccer field or going to the cinema, games are no different. That said, I trust that Frost Giant will listen to the community and design a fair monetization model. If monetization starts to feel greedy and more as a skimming strategy, it will definitely kill the game, as we already saw with other projects.

Stormgate still is on a rough path. The RTS audience is passionate but niche, and not easy to please. But I genuinely believe it succeeds. There are already a lot of accomplishments, a lot of proof that listen the community, and certainly there��s still a lot of promise, and it��s been exciting to watch it grow.
These are my current thoughts. I may update this review down the line.

Cheers.

201490063,"I've been following Stormgate since its infancy and first played it one of the closed alphas two years. Since then there have been a few missteps, or rather, there has only been one very large misstep in my eyes, which was the point in time they released to EA. I, and most of the alpha testers were forgiving because it was an alpha, but that didn't really translate to EA. It should've had more time to cook.

That said, the progress the Frost Giant team has made since EA launch has been fantastic. They took the feedback from the EA release to heart and narrowed the scope, focusing on a more polished vertical slice. Improving graphics/model/design, revamping the infernals, completely overhauling the campaign etc. We still have a long way to go, but the 1v1 and campaign has actually finally reached a point where it is pretty decent.

The community just recently gained access to the map editor alpha as well, which has been very exciting to follow. It is very impressive how well made some of the user made maps have been, especially considering how far from ""finished"" the editor is. 

Given the current state and the dedication/skill of the dev time, this warrants a recommendation from me.

I love this game, I love the story, the units, the diversity, everything. The only thing I wish is that it had more content and better management when it comes to microtransactions.

Now I know a lot of reviews say bad things about the microtransactions and I will agree with a lot of them. It does show they need money, every RTS game does, but I am not intimidated or bothered by what they are asking. 60 bucks buys the game, period. The rest are either commanders or cosmetics and I spent well over $500 on SC2 between the cosmetics, campaigns, and commanders. I have over 10,000 hours in that game. So I'd say money well spent.

I will be spending the $60 on this game soon, and I will be recommending people buy the game at full price when it comes out. I hope it rivals SC2 and the devs keep working on it night and day because I seriously want this game to at least be on par with SC2. I'm not asking for anything fancy. I just want more out of SC2 and this game so far has delivered. I will be playing it more.

I have a Steam Deck and let me say, it runs great on it. Even though during heavy fights of 3v1 Co'op I do get only 20fps at times, I dont get any real latency issues and the game still runs smoothly even at 20fps. They do need to optimize it better for the Steam Deck though and let me further reduce the graphics but I cant really expect that much out of this system. When I get a laptop i'll be playing the hell out of this game. 

For the record, I get BETTER performance out of this game than I do out of SC2 and yes, I play both on the Steam Deck. I do use a mouse and keyboard. SC2 gives me really bad rubberbanding effects, lag spikes, and FPS hiccups. This game does none of that.

200273629,"You can take the developer out of Blizzard, but you can't take Blizzard out of the developer.

Many of us supported this game because we wanted to see it succeed. A lot of us are hundreds of dollars deep into this game already. Why are there pre-day 1 microtransactions that we don't own? Was my $360 not enough? Now I need to be nickel and dimed with additional paid content on the first day of early access? Yes they gave me what was promised on Kickstarter. It still feels like a slap in the face that there is content in the game I don't own, literally before the game has even released.

The campaign is terrible. We're paying at least $5 per mission. It's almost like this is a meta commentary on people caring too much about the campaign so they purposely made it as horrible as they could. Maybe this is genius. The writing, the artstyle, this game isn't winning in any category. I have the graphics maxed out, the mouths don't move during cutscenes.

The co-op is half baked at best. I'm surprised at just how often Stormgate is falling flat on it's face when not only did these developers work on successful projects, they can just copy what they did before. You've done this already! You should know what to do!

It seems they've also forgotten one factor that made WarCraft 3 and StarCraft 2 so successful. The custom maps made by the community are wildly popular with a wide range of players. Are the map tools available? Of course not! This should have been a huge focus on getting out. Release the map tools to the community. Allow them to patch up the holes in this abysmal product. While you work out more trash campaign missions, the community could be keeping everything alive with custom games.

This is what I imagine a F2P version of WC3 would be like in 2003. Unfortunately for Frost Giant, it's no longer 2003. It's 2024 and this game is insulting. The graphics suck, the art style sucks, this game is behind on every metric I can think of. I paid so you don't have too. Avoid this product.

While audio balancing has become more complex, I struggle to understand how a developer with as many eyes as they had looking at them could do a pre-release that presents fundamental issues. The audio is bugged on my system and makes the game unplayable -- spoken dialogue comes out at double the amplitude of everything else, no matter what settings I choose. On top of this, the audio clips.

My PC's audio setup isn't exactly standard as using studio-level gear; but what's revealed to me nonetheless is sloppy coding that hits about the worst of any title I've loaded up in years.

The presentation is embarrassing; I don't think they're coming back from this one. The Starcraft scene is certainly further injured by this and the reputation of RTS is further tarnished. This game is having the complete opposite effect of its intended mission.

Then suddenly, Tempest Rising drops. I'm not sure about difference in budget, but TR is a modern rehash of classic RTS done with grace and polish. I always liked the spirit of Starcraft more than C&C, but it doesn't look like Stormgate is going to succeed.

199351527,"The Good:
Stormgate has good bones. It is markedly improving with every update, and gives off a nice nostalgia factor to those who played Starcraft and Warcraft. I find myself having fun with Versus and Co-op. I genuinely enjoy playing it.

The Meh: This game definitely needs more time to cook. It's pretty obvious that the Early Access is being used to get player feedback while FG is still building the game. Take EARLY ACCESS seriously. 

The Not-So-Good: Microtransactions this early in development was a definitive blunder. It definitely gave off the feeling that the devs were just out for cash. Players new to RTS may have some serious trouble getting into Stormgate. As a veteran of RTS (in hours played) but still a casual player, versus AI is a real challenge. On normal difficulty, enemy rushes come very quickly, and are quite dense. This can be brutal if you aren't on your game from the moment the match starts. Stormgate definitely comes across as a mix of Starcraft and Warcraft, but the split is about 90% Starcraft and 10% Warcraft.  The nostalgia factor can feel layered on pretty thick at times. I could absolutely see Stormgate having an identity crisis in the future if they don't continue breaking away from their Starcraft/Warcraft inspiration. The races for sure need further balancing as well, but I'm confident this will be fixed in the future.

Overall: It's an Early Access RTS taking heavy inspiration from industry legends. It's playable, and can be quite enjoyable for RTS veterans. Some to all of these issues could be ironed out in the future, so I'll update this as time goes on.

This is a solid MIXED review.

In the really big picture, the glaring issues since launch haven't been addressed.  The menus are bad, the opening things are broken.  The first screens that you look at and click on make no sense to be the focus of the game.  The introduction missions are annoying.  There's no place to boot up and feel like your not just thrown into the fire.  The easy ai attacks you at 3 minutes.  Most pvp are vs 1v1 tryhards on ping.  There's hotkeys that are super pain to setup and you can't setup multiple profiles if something works well in coop, but doesn't work well in 1v1.   The coop is broken in 0.5, the top bar abiltiies have stopped working and it frequently crashes.  There's really dumb passive race mechanics like infest or veterancy that really don't add anything.  The units either do almost nothing for one race like the kri and then a similar roles unit for another race can stun, splits in 2, has a wild attack, builds in supermassive waves and requires less micro like a brute.   How to do macro and build with the races is naive in simple.  The game is designed to be anticasual and most casual players will die within the first few minutes and never have an opportunity to get a stormgate.  The devs are largely tied into youtubers.  The campaign complaint was that it was short, so they removed the longest mission in the campaign and made it shorter in a rework?  It's like there's no testing done at all and no feedback regarding what is in it. 

Somehow they're just really missing the really big picture of what people view as a fun, accessible rts and almost everything they're addressing are not the really basic glaring issues.   Avoid the fans for this because they will just slam over and over anyone that says anything other than ESPORTS 1v1.
